6,Office (Loose Leaf) Tea Solution,"I am looking for a good system to make loose leaf tea at my workplace. The main requirements are that the tea tastes good and it is easy to clean in the toilet sink without much equipment. Bonus points if it's microwaveable, since I find that slightly more practical than an electric kettle.


I have considered:


* cup with a ceramic or glass strainer. Doubts: is the mesh fine enough, or would it let the smaller leaves through?
* steel strainers. Doubts: do they affect the water taste? Can they be closed tightly, or would they let the smaller leaves through? Is the steel mesh microwavreable?
* cotton strainers. Doubts: do they dry in a reasonable time? Do they get dark and dirty after a few uses?
* fillable disposable tea bags. Doubts: are they viable for a single person? They look quite expensive
* French press, ingenuitea, or other similar contraptions. Doubts: they don't look easy to clean at all. Are they microwaveable?


What is your experience? Do you recommend (or suggest to avoid) one of these methods, or a new one?

* cup with a ceramic or glass strainer.


I've tried both the ceramic type with holes and the glass type with slots. The mesh is never fine enough for me. In addition the holes or slots invariably get packed with leaves and are a pain to clean.

* steel strainers.


If you mean the tea-ball type, I can't comment. But a steel mesh strainer is my absolute favorite. I've been using the same one (pictured below) for years now and have never noticed any off flavors. Easy to clean: just dump out the leaves and give a good rinse, picking or sponging out the occasional stuck leaf.


Not microwaveable, but you don't want to microwave the leaves, anyway. Microwave the cup with water in it (put a stirrer in to avoid superheating the water. Yes, it can happen, and has happened to me), then put the strainer in when it's the right temperature.

* cotton strainers.


I have never used one, so I can't comment authoritatively, but it seems like at the least they'd be harder to clean.


* fillable disposable tea bags.


I hate disposable anything. I tried the type of bag pictured below and they were a pain. They tend to wick tea out of the cup and onto your table.

As for the other gizmos, I think for tea, simpler is better. The above are the only methods I've used, and I find the mesh basket is far and away the most convenient and best solution.

2,My hotpot has a stand attached to it,"So my dad bought a hot pot. I know what you cook in a hot pot. It says in the bottom ""Hot Pot."" But the bottom isn't what I expected. Normally, a hotpot is in a bowl shape. But this one has somewhat a stand. It's like a small inverted bowl attached to the bottom and it keeps the hotpot still. It's hollow. Is this normal? How do I use this hotpot? Do I just place the hotpot with it's stand on top of a stove?


",<cookware>,2018-02-08 14:19:17.187,87627,4,"You say you know what to cook in a Hot Pot and confirm that this product is identified on the body as a 'Hot Pot', but I think the issue may be that 'Hot Pot' means different things in different cuisines.
Where I come from a Hot pot is a lamb, potato and onion dish which is slow cooked in an oven. In East Asia it is a soup that simmers on the table while you cook morsels of ingredients in the broth. In India/South Asia, it is a vessel designed to keep cooked food warm until it is needed some hours later.


I suspect you were looking for a vessel suitable for the East Asian Hot Pot but what you have is an Indian Hot Pot.


This [short advertising video](https://youtu.be/3nPU-nIttdU) includes a model called a ‘dome hot pot’ which looks very similar to the one you have., and the video description call these ‘insulated casseroles’. 


I can’t find explicit product details for an insulated hot pot with a ‘foot’ design, but insulated or double walled hot pots are for keeping food warm, **not** for cooking it. As an example here’s a Q&A for a flat based version on amazon.co.uk[![screenshot showing amazon customer explaining how the insulation in his hot pot expanded and split the pot when he put it on the stove](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gktuw.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gktuw.png)

So, if I am correct and you have an insulated casserole, I would recommend you only use it to keep food warm, and do not place it on a stove. 


Indicators that it is an insulated casserole/hot pot would be:
- Indian origin
- lock/clip lid to keep food tightly sealed
- thick side walls and lid indicating two layers of metal with vacuum or insulation between.

4,My salmon burgers are bland,"I just tried to fry a salmon fillet and eat it as a I would a hamburger patty: with bread, cucumber and tomato. No matter my seasoning, I keep finding the taste bland.

Also, you will find a difference in taste between a farm raised and wild-caught salmon. Wild caught salmon have redder flesh (although some places have started dyeing farmed salmon), and have a much stronger salmon flavor than farm raised salmon.

3,English Breakfast vs Ceylon tea,"Which tea is stronger, i.e. gives a better puch for a wake up? I know that English Breakfast is a mix which among others includes Ceylon, and I read that Ceylon is a very strong black tea (the strongest apart from Chinese uberteas?). So, does it come out that English Breakfast is weaker because it only contains a share of Ceylon and the rest of the teas in the blend are of a weaker kind? Or is it actually stronger because of that and is used at breakfast to give a good kick?


",<tea><caffeine>,2016-06-08 08:36:03.390,70541,5,"There are two main traits of tea which deliver the punch you talk about:


1. Caffeine: this is a stimulant, and there is wide variation on the amount of caffeine in black teas depending on a number of factors. [Here](http://ratetea.com/topic/caffeine-content-of-tea/21/) is a good article which goes into some detail on caffeine in tea. A simple way to put it is that variety doesn't mean much, one assam may have much more caffeine than another, so saying a tea is a blend of assam and ceylon doesn't mean it has more or less caffeine than pure assam.
2. Flavor: A stronger flavored drink provides more stimulation to the brain than a weaker flavored drink. The more something attacks your taste buds the more wake-up power it has. Orange juice has no caffeine but it still has eye-opening properties for most people


English breakfast teas are blends of strong-flavored tea varieties like Assam and Kenyon, they are designed to be drank with milk and maybe sugar. Ceylon is actually a lighter flavored tea, usually used in afternoon blends for a lighter taste, although it can be used in english breakfast tea. Caffeine-wise they vary but strength of flavor does not imply caffeine content if the quantity of tea used is the same. If you get a stronger tea by adding more leaves to the brew then you get more caffeine of course. 


So english breakfast tea is a good eye-opener as much from its strong flavor as its caffeine content. Ceylon is less strongly flavored but probably similar caffeine content per weight of tea, so would be less of an eye-opener.

1,Is kimchi a suitable addition to a noodle soup?,"I have just returned from having purchased a can of kimchi. I have no idea what the contents are, since they are written in Korean, but thought that mixing it into the broth at the last minute might increase the soup's flavour.


Is there a flaw in my reasoning?


",<soup><kimchi>,2012-04-12 00:27:01.867,23010,3,"Kimchi are not preferred to be added directly to soup. Usually you would fry the Kimchi (ideally in Sesame oil) to slightly transparent or having minor brown on the edges, before adding into the soup, and boil for . That is not only applicable to [KimChi JiGae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi_jjigae)- but also other varieties of KimChi broth (e.g. hotpot, Kimchi ramen/noodles (BuDae JiGae) etc.) 


Adding Kimchi directly to soup/broth and boil is more a Northern Chinese way of cooking (where Kimchi is not called kimchi but literally called ""Spicy Pickled Cabbage""). 


Frying beforehand and adding directly to soup/water can taste very, very different.

10,How to convert a recipe calling for active dry yeast into rapid rise yeast?,"I have a recipe for rolls where the first stage calls for 2 packages active dry yeast, 1 tbsp sugar, and 1/2 cup warm water to be mixed until the yeast is proofed, and then 1/4 cup cubed butter is added to the proofed yeast. Then all of that is added to half of the flour (2 cups) and 2 tsp salt and allowed to do the first rise. 


If I wanted to use rapid rise yeast instead of active dry, could I skip the proofing step? Would I need to add the butter at all? Could I just mix all the dry ingredients, add the warm water and start the dough that way? What effect would this change have?


",<baking><yeast><bread>,2010-11-22 05:57:04.867,9364,16,"First off, it's good to understand the difference between active dry yeast and rapid rise yeast. Active dry yeast is a larger granule of yeast in which the outer shell is composed of mostly dead cells entombing the dormant nougaty goodness inside. It has to be proofed to seperate out all the cells and rehydrate the interior active cells.


Rapid rise yeast is a typically a combination of 2 different strains of yeast (so those with a very discerning palate might be able to tell the difference, I've never really tried). The granules of yeast are smaller and dried slower to preserve more yeast cells. Ascorbic acid is also added to push the yeast into overdrive a little faster. 


A great video that helped me a lot is <http://how2heroes.com/videos/dessert-and-baked-goods/yeast-101> I have noticed before issues with Rapid Rise yeast not proofing very well the second time around. Apparently it's designed to give you one really good proof and then die out (play hard and die young). Instant yeast however is Rapid Rise yeast without the hardcore party attitude. It's what they use at the King Arthur bakery test kitchen, so that's good enough for me! They say to use them interchangeably, but many other sites I see show a difference of about 20%.


2 Tbsp Active Dry yeast ≈ 1.6 Tbsp Instant Yeast

2,Käsespätzle like the ones in Bavaria,"I'm really impressed how here in Bavaria people can cook some delicious things... Well I fell in love with Käsespätzle. I keep having trouble making them just like at the restaurant, where no matter what, the chef doesn't want to tell me his secrets.


I basically buy the Spätzle at the supermarket, let them cook 1 minute in salted and boiling water, then put them (without water of course) in a wok with some olive oil.
Meanwhile I ""fry"" onions chopped into small rings in a bit of oil until they become brown, and I prepare some grated Gouda cheese.
I put onions and cheese on the Spätzle and I stir until the cheese melts.
Easy.


The difference between mine and the restaurant's are the following:


* The Röstzwibeln (""fried onions"") are not totally crunchy
* The consistency of the Spätzle is somehow different
* The entirety doesn't seem to develop crunchy sides after the last steps


While I'm ok with the fact that the supermarket-Spätzle cannot be super-good, I don't get how to cook the onion and I feel that I'm using a wrong cheese (beware: I don't want CREAMY stuff, I want the CRUNCHY one!).


Can anybody help?


",<cheese><pasta><onions><german-cuisine>,2014-10-22 14:34:43.513,49160,4,"In order to get crispy-crunchy fried onions, you need to deep-fry them at a high temperature. Pan frying just won't get them crunchy, they'll just get softer and softer as they get browner and browner.

You say you know that supermarket-spatzle can't be super good, so I am not even going to go there. I'm sure you could find highly rated recipes yourself.


As far as cheese having crunch, the key there is to not stir it while it is getting a bit brown, either under the broiler or on the stovetop (or both, to get crunchy surfaces on both the top and bottom). Also consider using aged Gouda instead of young. That will reach a crunchiness faster, and the flavor will be more intense, allowing you to use less, which will also make it easier to get crunchy.


**EDIT:** Another thing you can do to get crunchy cheese is to bake it into crisps first, then crunch them up and sprinkle them onto (and into) your completed, or nearly completed, dish. That way you can get melty (with the same cheese baked in) and crunchy if you'd like. That will work with any hard, aged cheese like Parmesan or aged Gouda.

12,How long does bicarbonate soda (baking soda) keep?,"I am thinking of baking biscuits for presents for Christmas.


However, the recipe calls for baking soda, and I cook from scratch fairly rarely, so I'm worried the leftover bicarb will go strange in my cupboard. And since people use it for all sorts of purposes, it's one of those products generally not available in the small quantities called for in cooking.


If I do buy a packet, how long is an expected shelf-life for it? Based on [this question](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/12382/storing-baking-soda) I probably should find an airtight container to store it in, which may assist.


(Note if relevant: I live in Sydney Australia; Christmas here is mid-summer, and often fairly high-humidity and 35-40 degree C heat.)


",<storage-lifetime><baking-soda>,2011-11-08 20:16:41.380,18841,11,"[StillTasty provides a very conservative answer](http://www.stilltasty.com/fooditems/index/16439): 6 months at best quality. In my personal experience, it can last much longer and be just fine, though I think the longest I ever kept a box was a couple years, not 5 years like riotburn. StillTasty suggests that the concern after more than 6 months is lost potency, but I believe the potential to take on odors from the surroundings is much more of a concern; store it in something airtight like you said, and you should be pretty safe from that.


So I'm sure it'll last at least until next Christmas. And if you do get into baking, you might go through a box faster than you'd think. Otherwise, it's fortunately pretty cheap, and it does have other uses (e.g. cleaning) so it won't hurt you too much to just go for it.

3,I'm making tomato sauce which never thickens,"I tried the following recipe. 


<http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/5211/amatriciana-pasta>


The result is tasty, but the sauce looks nowhere near the image. It is some red paste, yes, but with onions and bacon still clearly taking about half of the volume.


My guess is that I didn't let the onions caramelize long enough. Is this correct? Basically, the ""sauce"" I get didn't thicken much and the water from the tomatoes evaporated without leaving anything of substance.


",<sauce><tomatoes><onions><bacon>,2012-12-26 06:18:27.563,29464,4,"I wouldn't worry too much about your results not matching the picture.\* If you got enjoyable results, enjoy them. However, some notes can be made about your concerns.


The bacon certainly isn't going to disappear -- no matter what you do (short of blending), you will always be able to see those bits.


The onions in the sauce shouldn't really be *caramelized*, but they should be thoroughly sweated -- without coloring -- so that they are soft and just starting to be sweet. If you'd like the onions to disintegrate more, you can cut them differently: either dice them finely or slice them latitudinally. There are fibers in an onion which run from top to bottom, so if you slice from pole to pole, you get the whole length of it. If you cut across the fiber, the slice will break down much more when cooked.



> 
> the water from the tomatoes evaporated without leaving anything of substance.
> 
> 
> 


It sounds from that like you may actually have cooked it down *too long*. You can cook tomatoes all the way down to paste, if you like, but in this case you want to stop before that happens, leaving a fair bit of the tomatoes' juice, enough to coat the pasta when you mix them. It sounds like the sauce *did* thicken, and then went past that, to drying out.


Keep the time that the recipe gives for the tomatoes to cook down in mind only as a very loose guideline. Much more important is the results that you see on your own stove. The person who wrote down that recipe has a different pan, different burner, different kitchen... Of course, to know exactly what is right (for both your equipment and your preference), takes repitition, and thus the time-based guideline to put you in the ballpark.


I'd suggest just trying it again, paying particular attention to the consistency of the sauce after you add the tomatoes. Taste and evaluate it frequently as it cooks, and take it off the heat when it looks and feels the way you expect.


As an aside, if you're interested, the [official recipe for the sauce](http://www.comune.amatrice.rieti.it/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=41&Itemid=53) is available on the website of Amatrice (the town), although it's in Italian, of course.

1,Why is this Surume Ika (Japanese Flying Squid) discolored? (Ingredient for Ika Somen.),"I've been very interested in making Ika Somen. I found both a recipe online, and a recipe in ""Pass the recipe"", by Hiroko Nomura. Today I bought a Surume Ika (squid) from the local Japanese market. When I've purchased squid in the past, I've bought Yari-Ika.


When I cleaned the Surume Ika, the skin was blotched red in places. The squid didn't smell bad, but also didn't smell ocean-fresh either. I ended up discarding the squid, just in case. Would someone know if this discoloration is normal, and if not, what is it?

12,What's the point of roasting a whole chicken?,"Recently I tried to butterfly a chicken before roasting it (in the oven) and I totally liked it. It cooks faster, browns more evenly and is easier to carve. It's slightly more difficult to move the chicken from the pan and I can't put aromatics (like lemon) inside it. These are the only disadvantages I can imagine and they don't look as very important.


So my question is: why mess with a whole chicken if you can butterfly it? What advantages (and disadvantages of butterflying) am I missing?


And second question, related to the first: why even stop at butterflying if I can separate a chicken into parts before roasting? No need to carve at all and it solves the problem when breasts cooks faster than other parts (I can remove them earlier). What are the cons here?


",<baking><chicken><roasting>,2015-01-20 14:26:40.517,53806,20,"The reasons people still roast whole birds are:


* Roasting a whole chicken is easier than butterflying it. While it's not tough to butterfly a chicken many people don't know how, or don't want the cleanup
* It's less prep time to roast a whole chicken. If you are busy you can have it from the fridge to the oven in less than a minute, while butterflying or jointing it isn't super-quick

1,"The muffins were rock hard, what did I do wrong?","Here is the recipe I used, I did not mix it for long, as that make the muffins very hard. 


The muffins were very hard, and had a bad after taste and smell. I missed adding some oil, but what else could be the reason ?


* Red Millet Flour, 50 g
* Whole Wheat flour, 50 g
* Toasted Oat Bran, 40g
* Whole Green Mung Beans - Sprouted, 100 g
* Domino - Light Brown Sugar 50g
* Baking Soda, 2 tsp
* Salt, 1 Tablespoon
* Liquid Egg White, 4 eggs
* 100% Whey (Vanilla), 75g
* Chobani - Greek Yogurt - 0% Vanilla, 5.3 oz (small packet)
* Carrots - Raw, 1 cup, grated
* Bananas - Raw, 1 cup, mashed
* White, all-purpose, enriched, bleached, 40 g


Also I wanted to try yeast instead of baking soda, but due to eggs and other veggies I cannot let is rise overnight (any ideas ?). I was trying to make good protein muffins which are an ideal breakfast, grab one with a glass of milk and done! 


They run approximately 160 calories per muffin 25g carbs, 1g fat, 12g protein.


",<muffins><quickbread>,2014-05-13 15:34:14.427,44105,8,"What makes muffins soft is starch and fat. You have no fat at all in these ""muffins"", and very little flour when compared to the vegetables and proteins. 


Normal muffin proportions are 2:2:1:1 flour:liquid:egg:fat (per Ruhlmann). I guess you can add up to 2 parts **filler** (so as much vegetable as flour) before you get the result too terrible. In your mixture, there is a total of 140 g flour and ~700 g fillers (bran, beans, whey, carrots, bananas). This is never going to be muffin-like, you will have to forgo most of your additions. And the whole wheat **flour** is also making it harder. You either have to change to normal flour, or live with some hardness (it should be manageable if you change all the other factors). 


The **liquid** provided by the yogurt is good if you switch to white flour, no need to change anything there. You may consider adding a bit if you stay with whole wheat, it ""soaks"" more liquid. 


The **egg whites** are a problem too. First, egg whites make baked goods dry out. You shouldn't be using pure egg whites, they will make bad muffins. You need whole eggs. And second, the equivalent of 4 eggs (200 gram) is probably too much. 1-2 whole eggs would be normal for this amount of flour, 3 makes it pound-cake-like but still usable. Still, you may find out that, if you make all the other changes, upping the (whole) eggs to 4 doesn't make it too bad. 


You also used too little **sugar**. Sugar is an important structural element in muffins. It retains moisture and prevents gluten buildup. It can be reduced if you don't want the taste or the calories, but each gram you take away also reduces the quality of the muffin, so you have to try out and see how much quality reduction you can tolerate. 


You had absolutely no **fat** in the recipe. The standard ratio suggests 75 g. This is also a major factor in softness and moisture. 




---


In short, you cannot take any muffin recipe, remove all the stuff which doesn't have the nutrients you don't want, fill it up with foodstuff you want, pour it into a muffin form and expect it to taste like a muffin. Baking is chemically very complicated, and most of the ingredients are not there for flavor, but for texture. Replacing them with random other ingredients will do nothing good. 


You can either return your recipe towards a more traditional muffin, which will of course change its nutrition values back to ""sweet baked good"", or you can find a different form of combining the foodstuff you have chosen to eat. Mixing it and baking it is not going to work.

It starts to get a bit stringy and losing the ""smooth"" shape that it was cut with, what could I be doing wrong, given that my favourite indian restaurants always have the chicken in a nice shape?

1. At the very beginning when frying your spices and/or onions, fry the chicken pieces and then take them out so they're sealed. Add water to the pan and whatever else you're using and bring the water down until it's like gravy. Put the chicken pieces back in - cover on low heat for ten minutes. Stir, then cover for a further ten minutes.
2. If you don't want to do something fidly, try to use a wide pan and put only enough water to just cover the chicken - cover for twenty minutes then uncover and cook until it looks yummy.

6,Fluffy texture in a Spanish tortilla,"I made a Spanish tortilla over the weekend and it reminded me that I don't get the right egg texture I'm after when cooking this.

The recipe (a Jamie Oliver one) is: fry off onion and diced potato in a large pan over a medium heat, when browned add some spices and crack in 8 eggs. When the sides of the tortilla start to come away pop under a hot grill until set.

You have two main choices:


* Reduce the impact of the sweetness. Increasing acidity (lemon juice or vinegar for example--since ketchup contains vinegar, vinegar or more ketchup may be most compatible with your specific recipe) may mitigate how sweet the soup seems. This may or may not work--you would have to experiment, and it could make the soup taste worse worse (the risk being you would then still have to discard the soup.)
* If you really like the borsht, and can eat (or freeze) it all: make a second batch with considerable *lower* sugar, and combine them. You will now have twice as much soup, but flavor balanced.

**Edit** I followed the recommendations and added some raw vegetables and a little bit more salt than usual. The fermentation process was fine and the end product was delicious. Note for future me, don't blanch cabbage for sauerkraut :) . It's less troubles.


",<food-safety><fermentation><cabbage><sauerkraut>,2019-09-12 14:27:16.180,102296,1,"That should work and be safe. The one thing I'd worry about is that blanching may have reduced the amount of lactic acid bacteria available for fermentation; that might delay fermentation, or even encourage the growth of unwanted microorganisms. If possible, I'd suggest mixing the blanched cabbage with a small amount of raw cabbage (or any raw vegetable, really) before salting and packing the sauerkraut, and keeping the salt content near the higher end of the range for sauerkraut.

4,Consistently getting cannoli shells off their molds easily,"When I fry cannoli shells, I find that about a quarter of them -- apparently at random -- stick to their molds so that they are hard or impossible to remove without breaking.


The two tactics I use to combat this -- which do make a difference, but not 100% -- are to spray the molds fairly heavily with vegetable oil before wrapping the sheets, and to wrap loosely. I don't roll the sheet tightly around the mold.


When unmolding, I've found it best to wait until the shells are completely cool. Then, for the ones that stick, gripping the shell (as firmly as possible without immediately shattering it) and gently twisting either it or the mold often helps it break free. Sometimes the shell is damaged in the process, though, and sometimes it won't come off at all without being smashed.


The dough is made with vegetable shortening (lard isn't an option, unfortunately: they need to be vegetarian), all-purpose flour, wine, and sugar, and rolled out to translucency on a pasta machine. I'm extremely happy with the product, but I'm open to changing the formulation if evidence suggests that e.g., there's too much moisture. (Although on that point, I've tried making the dough as dry as possible while still coming together, and it didn't seem to have an effect.)


What other possibilities am I missing? What can I do to make unmolding more reliable?


",<pie><deep-frying>,2015-01-02 07:19:53.930,59635,5,"Sometimes the simplest solutions are the best. I've found that simply increasing the amount of oil on the molds makes the shells slip off cleanly every time.


There needs to be a visibly thick layer of oil on the parts of the mold that the sheet touches. I've taken to using pourable vegetable (canola) oil rather than spray. I have the molds in a pan, pour the oil over them, and then take care to roll each mold in the oil to coat it thoroughly before wrapping a sheet around it.


It's surprising to me that so much oil is required when the thing is about to be submerged in oil, but it does make a considerable difference, and doesn't seem to affect the texture of the shell.

4,Do all blenders have the problem of food sticking to the side away from the spinning blades?,"We have a fairly cheap (50$) blender and when we puree food the food constantly sticks to the sides so we have to stop the blender 10 times to push the food back down so that the blades hit it. Is this common, or would a nicer/more expensive blender solve this problem?


",<equipment><blender>,2010-08-22 20:25:52.910,5784,0,"The ratio of food to size of container will make a large difference as well as the the texture of the item being blended. 


This has been a problem for me with traditional blenders. I've found that an immersion (stick) blender helps tremendously with this in two specific ways:


First, with a stick blender, you are basically holding the blade and can move it around, preventing food from separating and sticking to the sides.


Second, most immersion blenders come with small bowl accessories that in essence give you a ""mini blender"". Since the bowl is smaller in size, food separating and sticking to the side isn't as much of an issue. 


Immersion blenders are pretty cheap -- you can get one for as little as $20. I have the Braun model. It's amazing but I think they stopped making it. The best one on the market now is the KitchenAid.


I use mine for hummus, soups and pestos. It's without a doubt one of the most useful tools in my kitchen.

17,"What does ""lightly crushed"" mean for cardamon pods?","I am currently attempting to make the “Fragrant Spiced Rice Pudding” on page 136 of “Gordon Ramsay’s Home Cooking.” 


I am a novice with cooking so forgive me if my question is common sense for those more experienced.


The recipe calls for “2 cardamom pods lightly crushed” along with some other spices which I heat in a pan prior to mixing in any other ingredients. In the image accompanying the recipe I can see he leaves in the vanilla pods, and thiis leads me to believe that I am leaving in the husks of the cardamom pods. 


My question is regarding the phrase “lightly crushed.” Does this involve breaking open the husks and crushing the seeds inside or just crushing the husks so that they crack open?


",<spices><language>,2019-04-17 01:17:37.600,97522,25,"I'm pretty sure it's just crushing the husks a bit so they crack open - that's how I do it when I see ""lightly crushed"" for cardamom pods. It gives access to the seeds inside so flavor can infuse out of the pod and into the dish. The whole pod should be visible in the recipe, and removed before eating (would be a woody bite, else). 


If you crush the husk in smaller bits, which would be needed to get to & crush the seeds, it would be harder to find and fish out, and more likely some huskish bit would find its way into and leave its texture in a bite. Its similar to how cinnamon would be used in big chunks of a stick that can be fished out, or else ground really finely into dust, but not left in a dish in in-between-sized little fragments - the texture is just not desirable


If the recipe wanted crushed or ground seeds to release the flavor, it would have asked for seeds instead of (or as well as) a whole pod.

18,Can whole chilli peppers be frozen?,"I have some [Dorset Naga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorset_Naga) chilli peppers bought from the local supermarket.


[![Tesco Dorset Naga Chillies](https://i.stack.imgur.com/47fwH.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/47fwH.jpg)


Aren't they lovely? :)


Well, unfortunately, my local supermarket (I think the only one in the UK that stocks them) doesn't always have them in stock, so when they do appear on the shelves, I quickly stock-up on them.


Storing them in the fridge, they'll last maybe a week or so before starting to deteriorate.


My question is, can these chili peppers be frozen and, if so, will freezing them have any ""negative"" effects ?


I buy these particular peppers for their heat (and also their great smoky flavour), so I'd hate for either the heat or the flavour to be negatively impacted if they were frozen.


",<freezing><chili-peppers>,2010-08-15 12:49:47.100,5230,21,"Yes, they can be, but you'll want to prick each one with a sharp knife once or twice to prevent them from bursting. Once that is done, put them into a small freezer-safe storage bag, remove as much air as possible from the bag, and seal it. They keep reasonably well for about six months without tasting ""burnt,"" but they tend to be a tad mushy upon defrosting.


I always thought the mushiness factor had to do with length of freezing time, but since you asked, I did a bit of research. Apparently, what makes chilies turn to mush actually has to do with how quickly they initially freeze:



> 
> The undesirable mushy end product that comes from freezing fruits and vegetables isn't from the act of freezing itself, but from how you freeze. Your ordinary freezer, or even deep freezer, freezes food slowly. Chilies have water in their membranes, and as they slowly freeze, it forms jagged ice crystals that pierce and puncture the membrane, so that when you defrost it, you're left with a leaky and ""tenderized"" result. The solution to this problem is easy … faster freezing. If the water doesn't have time to form jagged ice, you won't have a mushy membrane.

[Happy Living](http://www.happynews.com/living/cooking/freeze-chilis-storage.htm) (from which I pulled the above quotation) has an article about how to safely use dry ice to freeze chilies quickly. (I'll probably keep going the way I always have and accept the mushiness, but if you want to freeze a lot of chilies for a variety of applications, the dry-ice method looks promising.)

7,Does a home produce refrigerator exist?,"It seems there are many foods that benefit from 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit / 10 to 15 degrees Celsius storage temperature--herbs, peppers, tomatoes, etc. As it stands, I store tomatoes and some herbs on the counter, which shortens their shelf life.


Is there a small home refrigerator available that will provide a suitable environment for such produce?


",<storage-method><food-preservation><refrigerator>,2013-05-09 03:58:16.253,34028,6,"You could try wine coolers\*. Wine likes temperatures around 50F, so they should all be around the temperature you want, and the nicer ones will have accurate thermostats too. 


Mini-fridges could work - if their warmest temperature setting is warm enough. But be careful: they tend to have *very* bad circulation. On normal fridge temperature settings, a lot of them range from frozen on one end to too warm on the other end. If you set it warmer, you might end up with a range from too cold to room temperature. If all you're storing in it is roots, this is totally fine, but it could cause problems if anything is sensitive. So your mileage may vary, and it can be tough to tell without buying and trying.


That said, you don't want temperatures that cold for tomatoes. Storing them at room temperature is fine and generally recommended, unless your room temperature is excessively hot. (For example, Harold McGee says this in On Food and Cooking, and that temperatures below 55F will mess with the texture.)


Most herbs also do pretty well in the refrigerator, wrapped loosely with paper towels inside an open bag. Things like basil that like warm weather do better at room temperature, with cut ends in water, like flowers. (You can also do this in the fridge, if you're having problems with them drying out too much - you'll want to cover the ""bouquet"" loosely with a bag still.) See [How to Store Fresh Herbs](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/139/1672) for more.


The things that you might want to store at intermediate temperatures are root vegetables - this is why they were traditionally [stored in cellars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cellar) (like wine). Potatoes, for example, have an ideal storage temperature around 45-50F. But it's not a huge concern; their storage lifetime is pretty long at room temperature. Unless you find them sprouting before you use them, there's not much to worry about!


\* Note that I said wine *cooler* not wine *cellar* - in general the ones marketed as cellars are more expensive, but there are ones marketed as coolers that are back down closer to the minifridge price range. Rumtscho's additional suggestion of drink refrigerators is probably good too - though quickly searching, I didn't find ones that were any cheaper than the cheap wine coolers.

8,How do I make dried blueberries?,"How do you make dried blueberries? Can I use an oven? Is there a proper technique or do I just bake them on low for a few hours?


",<fruit><drying><blueberries>,2010-08-25 03:27:07.400,5921,10,"While you could probably do dried blueberries in a VERY low oven (150F), you'll most likely need to prop the door open slightly to allow moisture to escape. You'd be best to do them in an actual food dehydrator which will have a fan to expell the moisture being released from the food.


Keep in mind however that if dried as they are, they will shrivel up into fairly hard little bits. If your goal is something similar to the dried blueberries that you can buy in retail stores, they will have to be treated in a sugar syrup to maintain the chewy texture and keep them from totally drying out. I'm not sure if the commercial producers are first drying and then soaking in a sugar solution and perhaps drying again so that the sugar is drawn into the cells of the berry. Whatever the case...commercial dried cranberries and blueberries maintain the chewy texture due to being treated with a sugar solution at some point.


If you are looking for ways to handle a bumper crop or bulk buy on blueberries, I would recommend freezing them and stick to buying commercially processed dried berries for the best results, least effort, and greatest bang for your buck.

4,Help translating an older Recipe,"I have an old recipe handed down from my great great grandmother in law, for what she called brown bread. Unfortunately it has a few ingredients that I don't recognise. I did some searching on google and I thing I have figured out what different things are but I want to make sure. 


The Recipe calls for:


* Sour Milk : Is this butter milk?
* Sweet Milk : Is this whole milk?
* Graham Flour : This seems to be hard to find, but is still Graham flour.


Then baking is to be done in 4 metal vegetable cans. Can this be done in a loaf pan?


**As Requested**


1 Cup Sour Milk  

1 Cup Sweet Milk  

3 Cups Graham Flour  

1/4 Cup sugar  

1/4 Cup Molasses  

1/2 Cup butter  

1 tsp Salt  

1 tsp soda (I am assuming Baking soda)  

1 tsp BP (I am assuming baking powder) 


Bake at 325 in 4 metal vegetable cans for one hour


I would assume it mixes like a cake, and to add the wet and dry ingredients seperatly, finally combining them. But this is all the recipe I have to go on. So I expect to have to experiment a bit.


",<ingredient-selection>,2015-12-30 17:54:28.710,64934,6,"""Sweet milk"" is indeed standard fresh milk. It is just how people used to talk about it, to distinguish it from ""sour milk"". 


""Sour milk"" is also ""buttermilk"". It seems that over the years, people stopped selling actual buttermilk (which is the whey left after removing the fat from the sour milk) and started using the name ""buttermilk"" for what used to be known as ""sour milk"". 


If you can't find graham flour, whole flour of mid-coarse grind will be a good approximation. 


Baking soda and baking powder are good guesses. You could go with the original amounts, but if the first batch comes out overleavened, try reducing it. In the decades since the recipe, producers have found out how to make baking powder which does not go stale too quickly, does not lose much of its action on touching the liquid, and so on. So maybe the amounts are better suited to weaker leavening. No way to know without trying. 


The cans are not a good idea. I don't know about cans then, but the new ones could be lined with plastic (which will melt), or be rusty. The recipe is very obviously a cheap recipe from times of limitations, maybe Depression or WWII. Just use a baking pan. If you are afraid of bad leavening, using a wide one or two small ones is better than a single deep one. 


Also, don't trust the ""one hour"" suggestion, not only because you're changing pans and because the ingredients might have changed in subtle ways over the years, but also because baking by time is always unreliable. Test them for doneness with a thermometer, or in the worst case with a toothpick.

2,Preserving taste when freezing fish,"As some sort of continuation to this question: [Is IKEA frozen salmon sushi safe?](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/94076/is-ikea-frozen-salmon-sushi-safe)


Will the freezing process to make fish sushi safe alter the taste of it, compared to raw, just caught and cleaned fish (assuming the latter would be safe to eat, which is not)?


I always wondered if making fish safe altered the taste, and if there was a way to make this effect minimal


",<freezing><fish><sushi>,2018-11-20 15:01:05.097,94090,2,"So, if you've has sushi in the USA, you've had sushi that's been previously frozen. US regulations [do not allow serving raw-from-the-ocean fish](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/08/nyregion/sushi-fresh-from-the-deep-the-deep-freeze.html). For that matter, even in Japan, salmon is frozen before serving as sushi, because as a fresh-and-salt-water fish, salmon [has multiple parasites that are directly transmissable to humans](https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/05/how-to-prepare-raw-fish-at-home-sushi-sashimi-food-safety.html).

Speaking from personal experience, I have had actual raw sushi while in Japan (some fish and shrimp were even killed in front of me). It does make a difference in taste and texture, especially for toro (fatty tuna) and ebi (sweet shrimp). Beyond that, it's a bit hard to tell the difference between the effects of freezing and the effects of quality differences in fish (I had raw fish in the Tsujiki fish market), and unless you can get ""caught yesterday"" fish you don't want it raw anyway; fish degrades quickly.


So, so sum up: if you have access to caught-this-morning, ocean-only fish (not salmon), you should try it raw for sushi, but previously frozen is still pretty good, and safer.

3,How does produce grading in the US work?,"The US has a lot of standards about grading produce. Is everything graded on the same scale (with the same labels)? What characteristics do the grades generally depend on, and what characteristics do they ignore?


And is all produce graded, so that for example I can go to the store and find out what grade their supply of a given fruit is?


",<vegetables><fruit><produce><standards>,2016-01-26 00:41:48.330,66215,3,"* Is everything graded on the same scale (with the same labels)?


No. Grading is specific to every kind of fruit or vegetable, and often grading can be different depending on the form of the produce (fresh vs. canned vs. frozen vs. juice vs. headed for further processing, etc.). 


Also, different nomenclature is used for different produce: some use ""Grade A,"" ""Grade B,"" etc. Some use ""No. 1,"" ""No. 2,"" etc. The number of grades can vary. And some use other nomenclature like ""Fancy Grade"" or ""Commercial Grade,"" either by themselves or in combination with the numerical/letter grade system.


* And is all produce graded, so that for example I can go to the store and find out what grade their supply of a given fruit is?


Grading is voluntary, and it generally costs producers to do it. Unless there is a complaint about quality, many domestic producers won't bother, particularly if they are selling at a local market or something. For marketing agreements, they are often required, though. And international shipments are required to be graded, but only small samples from a given shipment are generally inspected.


* What characteristics do the grades generally depend on, and what characteristics do they ignore?


You really can only tell by reading the individual grading policies for specific produce (there are guidelines for well over 100 different types/forms of fruits and vegetables). The guidelines for [fruits are here](http://www.ams.usda.gov/grades-standards/fruits) and for [vegetables are here](http://www.ams.usda.gov/grades-standards/vegetables). Also, note that these are only national USDA guidelines. States and regional markets can also set their own grading policies, so a ""medium"" tomato sold at a state farmers market might be the same as an ""X-large"" tomato on the USDA grading scale.


But in general, grading often covers things like:


* Size (sometimes specifying different size grades or minimum size for grading)
* Appearance (color, shape, ""mature"" enough to ensure proper ripening if not ripe already, proper trimming if applicable, extraneous pieces like stems on small fruit, etc.)
* Texture (firmness, smoothness, general ""ripe"" characteristics, etc.)
* Defects (blemishes, dirt, decay/spoilage, pest damage/disease, damage from sun/heat or cold, foreign material, etc.)
* Allowable tolerances (allowed deviation levels in above characteristics or percentage of pieces allowed to be non-compliant in various characteristics)


Characteristics generally NOT covered by grading:


* Flavor/taste
* Interior of produce (since grading generally focuses on exterior inspection unless there is suspicion of unseen rot, disease, etc.)
* Packaging (beyond some note of packing that is likely to damage produce)

As for benefits -- it's habit at this point, so I'm not really sure -- I guess it's made from things I always have on hand.

But just as America doesn't recognize the European protection for parmesean, champagne, etc, European countries don't recognize the American protections.


I've talked to a local Wagyu farmer, and he said that true Kobe has to be processed in Japan (and he said it in an ambigous enough way suggesting that it might be possible for American-raised cattle to be shipped back to Japan for processing), and they're given a specific diet and treatment that doesn't happen in the US. (I also tried to talk him into selling me 1/2 a cow, and at the time (3-4 years ago?) he said it was in such high demand that all of his cows were sold before he even started raising them. At that time, Wagyu was still pretty rare in the US, and it was being sold as Wagyu ... it only seems to be more recently (last 1-2 years) that I've people selling it in the US as 'Kobe'.


Most of the ""American Wagyu"" has also been cross-bred with an American cattle. (The story I've heard is that the sperm was brought over, not live cattle, so they had to start with American heffers). So it's going to have some percentage of Longhorn or Angus in it.

I have a gas stove top, and I like to cook with a wok.

You could also do what Alton Brown does and use the bottom half of a turkey deep fryer, outside preferably, and not over any pipes or electrical wiring or gravel.

Or the oil is not hot enough when put in the container. I suggest putting the residue from the sausage in a gravy not for the Toad in the Hole.


P.S. I don't know what (from the linked recipe) the sausage chunks means, but keep your sausages whole imo.

1,Cooking meat/fish without Maillard reaction(a.k.a. browning),"Maillard reaction (browning) is the chemical reaction that occurs during frying. Almost all the recipes on cooking meat/fish are all about frying. Even if it's not frying it still mostly incorporates frying and/or browning. Most recipes of stewed meat suggest frying before actually stewing. Recipes for soups require frying everything before adding it to the soup. Recipes for baking mostly require to pour oil on top of everything to use browning.
Are there any good methods to cook meat/fish without browning?


",<meat><frying><fish><maillard>,2016-03-08 13:43:41.537,67230,4,"I agree with Joe: wet methods are generally good for preventing browning.


The general policy is just to use temperatures which are as low as possible (while ensuring food safety and cooking until ""done""). The other thing you want to avoid is very long cooking, since browning reactions can still occur if you cook something long enough at a low temperature.


Wet methods are often best both because they naturally keep the temperature of the food below boiling, and the circulating liquid helps to raise the food's temperature faster (which tends to allow quicker cooking). Compare that to roasting (or similar techniques) at a very low temperature -- in that case, it will often take much longer for the food to get up to a ""done"" temperature (which can sometimes be a food safety issue, particularly in large hunks of meat). 


Acids can also inhibit browning a bit, though low temperature and shorter time are most important.


The sous vide technique is perhaps the optimal method for preventing browning, since you cook the food in a sealed bag to a low temperature (and usually one specified to ensure food safety). You also contain all the juices, etc. of the meat, rather than other wet methods where they tend to be lost to the surrounding liquid. (If you are going to consume the liquid as well, that can be good, though.)


The main problem with all of these techniques is that some meats are considered much less appetizing without any browning. For example, many people love a steak cooked to a perfect ""medium rare"" inside, but they brown the exterior -- and even that thin layer of browned bits is enough to give a lot of flavor to a bite of even a thick steak. If you didn't brown the outside and just had the whole thing ""medium rare,"" it would be a different experience. Think of the interior of a medium rare prime rib -- in that case, many people often tend to use some salty flavorful ""jus"" or another kind of sauce to add flavor while eating the meat. So in some cases you might look for recipes that add a sauce or other complementary flavorful foods to go with the meat (and replace the missing flavor from browning).

41,Why should (or shouldn't) we wash rice before cooking?,"There are pretty confusing articles on this topic on the internet.
Some suggest that we should wash them to remove starch, talc, etc. Some suggest that we should not wash them because they are fortified with minerals.


This also varies according to the type of rice - short grain, Jasmine, Basmati, etc. It would be great to have logical reasons instead of just instructions.


",<food-safety><food-science><rice><nutrient-composition>,2016-08-26 20:04:33.617,73478,37,"Reasons to wash your rice:


1. Reduce/Control Starch levels


	* Often when you're cooking rice you want distinct grains of rice and for your rice to have texture. In the case of Chinese fried rice for example, you specifically want your rice grains to not stick to one another. If you're talking white rice especially, there will be a lot more loose starch that will form a thickish paste if if you don't rinse it away.
2. To clean out impurities


	* I imagine there was a time when there were a lot more impurities (dirt, dust, bugs, etc...). I don't know if that's necessarily the case these days with modern manufacturing. If you're concerned about your source, then this may be a factor for you. There's also the [occasional random article](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-10-03/features/ct-food-1003-rice-arsenic-cooking-tips-20121003_1_arsenic-rice-consumption-cooked-rice) that suggest rinsing to reduce levels of something like arsenic (see [FDA warning](http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/Metals/ucm319870.htm) on arsenic in rice)... I think 1. is your bigger factor here though.


Reasons to not wash your rice:


1. It removes nutrients.


	* This is true for fortified rice. See [here for more information](http://www.ffinetwork.org/about/faq/faq_rice_industry.html) on the fortification process. Note, whole grain/brown rices are less often fortified (I want to say they're not fortified, but I actually don't know for sure). So it would depend on what kind of product you're buying and where it came from.
2. You actually want to keep the extra starch.


	* This is the case for things like risotto where the starch is what gives the dish it's creaminess. [Serious Eats has a great article](http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/10/the-food-lab-the-science-of-risotto.html?ref=obinsite) that talks about the process.

8,How much can I change a NY cheesecakes recipe?,"My sister recently started making NY cheesecakes (Baked) according to an online recipe she found. I assisted her in doing so, and every time I mentioned any kind of change we could make in the recipe she refused to even think about that stating ""you should be loyal to the recipe"" and ""don't make comments about things you don't know"".


So I'm wondering: how much can I change a recipe for a different result?  

Can I swap ""petit beurre"" biscuits with ""digestive"" biscuits?  

Can I use any other kind of starch instead of corn starch?  

In general, is it wrong to make drastic changes in a recipe?


P.S.: I am the kind of a person that tries different things to find the right way to do things, more of a trial and error kind but with the recent spike in the prices in my country and the economy we have I can't afford trying and failing no more, so I have to ask about everything beforehand, even the simplest things.


",<baking><cheesecake>,2019-11-30 21:12:31.640,103833,24,"Many beginners in the kitchen get advice along the lines of “you can play around with cooking, but baking recipes shouldn’t be changed or you risk failure” or something similar. This is only partially true. 


Whenever you consider substitutions, you need to *consider what the purpose of the given ingredient is*. This will help in finding the answer to the “can I substitute” question. A few examples:


* Corn starch thickens - potato starch will do the same, plain flour will usually work, but may affect the mouthfeel and flavor a bit.
* Substituting one kind of dry biscuit for another will be no problem texture-wise, as the crumbs are bound together with the butter, but of course each kind will give a different flavor - and if you use a recipe that adds sugar to the crumbs you want to compensate the difference in sweetness between the chosen biscuits. Still, crumb crusts are quite forgiving.
* Dairy is tricky - especially if it’s *the* main ingredient. Using a low-fat softer type instead of the rather firm “bricks” of cream cheese in US recipes can backfire badly. Here the different water content must be compensated, which means you need to adjust other binding ingredients. And the flavor will be different.


If in doubt, it’s always a good idea to check lots of recipes for the same dish. The common denominators should become clear as well as the range of variations.

2,Way to fix sharp tasting sauce,"I've made a sauce with some white wine (with cream & tarragon) but it's really sharp. Probably the wine was a bit old, or I didn't boil it off well enough - is there any way to fix it?

",<sauce><wine>,2011-10-31 21:00:13.370,18705,6,"If ""sharp"" means too much alcohol left, bring it back to a simmer and cook off more of it, then adjust with more cream if needed.


If ""sharp"" means too acidic, your options are:


(1) add more cream and other ingredients to dilute the acid
(2) try to mask the acid with a bit of sugar
(3) I guess you could try to neutralize the acid with a very small amount of something basic, like baking soda. But that seems like a bad idea, it will probably taste terrible.

5,What's the best approach to baking bread with whole grains?,"I have a plethora of whole grains (barley, rye, wheat berries, kamut, spelt) sitting around my kitchen, and I'm getting bored with soups and salads. Is it possible to use these in bread (yeast, preferably, but quick/tea breads are also okay)? 


If so, what are the best approaches/ratios? Should I cook them first? Let them sprout? Pointers to recipes would be greatly appreciated.


",<baking><bread>,2011-03-16 15:14:28.917,13193,3,"I use whole grains in my bread- wheat, oats, quinoa, etc.


There are a couple considerations:
1- rehydration
If the grain won't be adequately rehydrated from just sitting in water for an hour then it should be precooked. Wheat berries, for example, definitely need to be cooked. They just won't get enough water or time in the dough while it is rising.


A little experimenting may need to be done to get the water ratio right.


2- sharpness
Adding hard ingredients will change the dynamic of your dough kneading. For example, if you knead in a mixer then you might have to go at a slower speed to keep from shredding the gluten.


Sprouting grains is fantastic. Sprouted grains are very nutritious and have a completely different flavor that I find very interesting. Sprouts also have a lot of sugar in them. I sometimes replace some of the sugar in my recipes with sprouted, dried, and ground wheat berries.

4,Cooler as a pantry?,"Spices (and many other things) are supposed to be stored in a dark, cool, dry place.


I live in an apartment (i.e. no dedicated pantry), in California (i.e. it's warm) and my kitchen is small so cupboards are close to the oven (so they're not exactly cool or very dry).


I was wondering: what would be a good pantry replacement in that situation?


A cooler (without the ice/water inside, of course) seems like a good replacement. Has anyone tried that and has practical experience with it?


Any other ideas for containers that can be used in an apartment as a pantry?


",<storage-method>,2012-04-27 23:35:52.463,23429,6,"Being near the oven doesn't necessarily mean that your cabinets aren't dry - they're probably as dry as any pantry.


I doubt a cooler is going to be significantly better than a cabinet. Without ice/water, it's just an insulator, so it'll resist change in temperature, which would tend to make the temperature variation inside it a little more moderate than that in the rest of your kitchen. (It'd also lag behind - it'll stay cooler as your kitchen warms up, then stay warmer as your kitchen cools down.) But more importantly, it's sealed, so there's no airflow. This may cause it to end up more humid than the rest of the kitchen.


The best thing is probably just to use the best available cabinets - low and as far from the oven as possible. They shouldn't heat up all that much from stove and oven use, and I'm guessing you use the oven more often in the winter, when the whole room is cooler anyway. If your kitchen is still getting too warm, try using a fan to circulate air with the rest of the apartment while cooking. Of course, in your case, in San Francisco, even the summers aren't that warm. You should really be fine using the cabinets. Failing that, you can always just buy a standalone shelf or cabinet, call it your pantry, and put it a little farther away.


If you're still having problems with spices not keeping well, you might want to just try to buy smaller quantities (if you have somewhere that sells them in bulk), or grind them yourself instead of buying ground spices. I wouldn't be overly concerned about storing them without light, either; so many people do just fine with spice racks (clear glass jars) on the counter.


Finally, some foods can also handle being stored in the refrigerator. Really depends what you're worried about!

If you have baked creme caramel or cheesecake, then try to get it to a similar consistency as these. If you haven't, you may want to use a roast thermometer. The final temperature (assuming a traditional flan without starch or flour) should fall in the 85-90 Celsius range.

1,Looking for Chicken & Dumplings pointers,"A young lady I know has informed me that ""Chicken & Dumplings"" is amongst her favorite dishes. I have only attempted this a few times with only marginal success. Mostly my dumplings end up too bland and too loose.

I would greatly appreciate any sage advise from the readers here. 


",<chicken><dumplings>,2011-05-30 01:21:49.790,15134,4,"I'm not sure about the texture (looseness), especially since those are two different methods. My best guess would be that it's just a flour measurement thing - moisture content in flour can vary, so the best thing to do is look for hints in the recipe about the desired texture (like ""It should tear slightly as it falls from the beater""), and increase or decrease the flour to match.


The primary flavors here are salt and chicken, so first just check the amount of salt in both dumplings and broth. For the chicken, you're getting all the flavor out of it by making broth. So make sure you used enough chicken (and not too much water), and that you cooked it long enough. Those recipes use a pressure cooker - if you don't have one, it takes way longer to cook, of course.

2,What is the magic time and temperature for stewing meat and vegetables?,"I made an oxtail stew in the crockpot/slow-cooker today, and 6 hours later I added the vegetables (carrots, onions, celery) which was also one hour before dinner time. Unfortunately, two hours later, the vegetables were still tough and crunchy, which earned me a reprimand from my wife for dinner being late. :-(
The reason why I didn't add in the vegetables from the beginning is because I didn't want the vegetables to be overcooked and too soft.


Motivated by the desire to earn praise rather than rebuke from my darling, what is the right time and temperature for stewing meat and vegetables? Is the solution to first sweat the vegetables?


What I have found so far:


1. According to Rose Prince (see [link](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/8167842/The-Kitchen-Thinker-The-science-of-meat-stew.html)), the magic time and temperature for a beef stew recipe is 7 hours at 80°C = 175°F
2. According to [What is the lowest possible temperature for stewing meat?](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/24737/what-is-the-lowest-possible-temperature-for-stewing-meat), vegetables should be done at 80°C-95°C


While point (1.) tells me how long to cook the meat, I'm not sure based on point (2.) whether that will leave the vegetables undercooked or overcooked.


",<stews>,2013-11-28 02:20:01.690,40894,2,"If you are going to wait until an hour before serving you definitely have to sweat the vegetables, you could also add them to the stew earlier, like half way through the cooking of the meat.

I also don't think that adding the vegetables with the meat for the whole cooking time is a problem, the vegetables take on all that flavor that the meat gives up.

",<grilling><vegetarian><hamburgers>,2011-06-27 01:57:06.940,15870,8,"I second the recommendation for Lukas Volger's [Veggie Burgers Every Which Way](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1615190198). I've been working my way through it and have made several of the recipes so far, all of which have been good. However, I would say that not all of the recipes in the book work well for the grill. 


I've been doing everything vegan from the Volger book with mixed results. Many of the recipes use eggs, but you can do them with just breadcrumbs and water as the binder. They come out pretty delicate that way and are better in a skillet and then baked, as Volger recommends. His tofu and chard burgers use some tofu that has been browned then pureed as binder. This works ok, but the burgers came out quite delicate (but still delicious).


Silken tofu pureed in the food processor gets a thick, creamy texture that could also be used as a binder.


Eggs are by far the most common binder as they may be the best edible binder there is, since they are basically liquid protein, but obviously not vegan. 


For delicate burgers, I use this [cooking grid](http://www.surlatable.com/product/PRO-625707/) on the grill, which works great. You can find something similar at most kitchen stores.


Another binder option is steamed rice, prepared like you would for sushi. It gets sticky and makes a great binder, though they'll still be a bit delicate. I've been making the beet, brown rice and black bean burger recipe from Volger's book. I add bbq sauce and a paste of pureed rehydrated prunes, similar to the veggie burger at Hillstone/Houston's restaurant and they come out really great. They work fine right on the grill, though refrigerating them overnight makes them a little sturdier.


Another option is adding vital wheat gluten and water, aka raw seitan dough. This is what is done in the [Veganomicon](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/156924264X) black bean burger recipe. I tried these straight on the grill also and they stayed together perfectly, as well as any commercial veggie burger. However, they were a little bland and could use some more seasoning.


I haven't tried any of these in burgers, but some common binders in vegan baking are peanut butter, apple sauce and [Ener-g egg replacer](http://www.ener-g.com/low-protein-1/egg-substitute.html). I bet peanut butter would work well in a burger with flavors that work with peanut, like Thai flavors or chipotle.


Falafel-style burgers also don't need any binders, they stick together pretty well and can be grilled, though you may want to use a grill grid or something similar.


Lastly, you can put a cast iron skillet or pizza stone on the grill - it's common now for grilled pizza and will work for delicate burgers.

(When I do oatmeal for breakfast, I prepare normal rolled oats as if they were instant - just add boiling water. I like some texture.)

If you don't have them and want to try it with something else first, look in your kitchen for metal or ceramic vessels which can stand upright and are several centimeters taller than the sauce level after displacement. This can be a thermos flask without the cap, or even a tall mug. Just put it there, again fill with some water, and fill the sauce around it. The biggest risk is that it topples over, and you end up with a somewhat watery sauce.

Instead, squeeze your citrus as normal and freeze the juice in an open container. Once it's set into a solid block, place it into a funnel or strainer over a collection vessel. The juice itself will run off more quickly and collect in the vessel, while the ice crystals stay in the strainer (until they melt, at least - don't let them melt all the way, or you're back to the beginning). Once the ice looks very lightly colored, discard it and enjoy your concentrated juice. You can repeat this process if you want further concentration, though eventually there will come a point where the juice is so concentrated that it won't freeze at conventional freezer temperatures.

Paul Hollywood is located in the UK and his book is aimed at locals (evidenced by comments about ideal kitchen temp of 20C to 22C, 68f to 71.6f). I live in Brisbane, Queensland. The ambient temperature yesterday was 28.5C (83f). He also states in the recipe to use water that is cool (around 15C / 77f) so I use water from the fridge mixed with tap water.


So my questions are:


* Does the ambient temperature of the kitchen affect the prove time? If so how?
* Does the water temperature have an impact on just the rise or on the proving as well?
* Should I shorten the prove time and if so how to I judge how much?


They really boil down to, how do I factor in the sub tropical climate when using a bread recipe written for the UK and north America?


Btw, I'm not keen on continually poking the dough while proving as I'm concerned that this may affect the prove.


",<bread><temperature>,2014-04-06 01:00:42.077,44631,1,"It could be the proving time or the oven temperature or both.


In hotter climates, bread dough will rise faster. Poking the dough will not harm the dough in any way, so don't be afraid to poke the dough. The best way to test if the bread dough has risen enough is by poking it. 


As for the oven, if the temperature is too low, it can take longer to get additional rise in the oven. What I do, as do many other bread bakers, is to bake the bread at the hottest temperature it can reach for the first ten minutes, then turn it down to the regular temperature for the remainder of the time needed to bake the bread. The hotter temperature initially can result in more oven spring for the bread.

20,Recommendations for spice organization strategies,"Spices have always been the hardest thing for me to keep track of in the kitchen. I'm interested in specific recommendations for 


1. hardware (containers, labeling, shelving, etc.) and
2. organization schemes (alphabetical? categories?)


in order to make it easier to find the spices I'm looking for. 


",<storage-method><spices><organization><pantry>,2010-07-09 19:32:43.237,15603,10,"Here's what I finally came up with - I'm very pleased with this solution.


![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PQMxi.jpg)


The [jars are from Amazon.com](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000ON8QXG), the labels are printed using a [Dymo LabelWriter Twin Turbo](http://global.dymo.com/enCA/Products/LabelWriter_Twin_Turbo.html), and the shelf is a [3-Tier Bamboo Expanding Shelf from Container Store](http://www.containerstore.com/shop/kitchen/cabinetOrganizers/upperCabinets?productId=10013618). 


My recommendations: 


* Use a label maker if you have one. Having everything printed the same way makes it prettier and also easier to scan.
* Using exclusively the same type of containers simplifies storage and also makes it easier to scan.
* Put the labels towards the tops of the containers, so they're visible above the tops of the next row down.
* This stair-step shelf expands to fit the horizontal space available, and can probably fit 
about 60 containers, which should be enough for anyone.
* I've gone with alphabetical order, which I've found to work very well. It has the advantage of being objective - there's no question where something belongs, and no taxonomical discussions about what category nutmeg belongs in.


As a bonus, this setup give me pleasure every time I look at it!

3,What sausage casing is this?,"So, I have no photo of this sausage, but to give you a picture: dry-cured chorizo, casing is easy to remove on thin slices, but on larger pieces the casing breaks sort of like paper – the edges becomes white (otherwise being transparent) and fibrous.

2,How much salt should be used in dishes for the best flavor?,"Is there a way to determine how much salt per quantity of food is required? For example if I use 1kg of ingredients then I need at most one tbsp of salt. Any such metrics?


The quantity of salt to be added to food is a major problem for many people just learning to cook. 


",<salt>,2016-09-02 01:57:53.210,73630,11,"There's a reason so many recipes say ""salt to taste"": there's no single answer. Most of the time, we use close to 0.5% salt by weight (so 1kg food has 5g or 1 teaspoon of salt), but ""close to"" leaves plenty of wiggle room about what exactly is *best*.


Different people have different tastes. What's perfectly salted for one person may be oversalted or undersalted for another.


Different dishes need different ratios too. Some things are *supposed* to taste a bit salty, while some just need a hint to amplify other flavors. Some ingredients need more salt to balance them than others.


Sure, you can get approximate starting points, e.g. [bread might be around 1% salt by weight](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120580907), [cookie dough might be about 0.5%](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/174864/original-nestle-toll-house-chocolate-chip-cookies/), [soups and stews might be something like 0.5%](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/lentil-soup-recipe.html) (with tons of variation - that's a couple random recipes). So *very* roughly, 1kg of food often comes with 5 grams of salt (1 teaspoon) with exceptions ranging up to 10 grams (2 teaspoons).


But your best bet is always going to be to find a good recipe for the specific dish you're making, and possibly adjust it if you know your preferences lean one way or another. Failing that, when cooking something improvised or new, or using one of the many recipes that just says ""salt to taste"", letting you do what suits you, trust the instincts that you've developed for your own tastes.


If you're cooking for others, with possibly varying tastes, it gets trickier. For things where salt can be added after the fact, you can use less salt and let everyone individually salt to taste. For things you can't mix after cooking, you pretty much have to compromise somewhere in the middle and hope it works for everyone.


Beyond that, if you can't decide what the right amount of salt is, don't worry about it. There's surely a range that works for you, so if two different amounts both taste good, there you are. And if you find yourself disagreeing with someone about what amount of salt results in the best flavor, stop. You probably just have different tastes from the person you're arguing with.

3,How to bake ground beef,"I have 3.5 pounds of 93% lean ground beef. I want to easily cook it like this:


* Put tinfoil on a pan.
* Put all of the ground beef on it.
* Put it in the oven preheated to 450F for 30 minutes.


Is this safe?


Any remaining questions:


* Why should it be covered? [When is it necessary to cover food with aluminum foil during baking/roasting?](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/776/when-is-it-necessary-to-cover-food-with-aluminum-foil-during-baking-roasting)
* Is there a problem with letting it cook in the fat?


",<baking><meat>,2015-09-28 20:00:19.493,62131,4,"Make sure you use a pan with high enough sides so that fat doesn't overflow. If it's a thin baking sheet with only short edges, especially one that tends to curve/warp in the oven, you could easily dump fat all over the bottom of the oven. But as long as it's a sturdy pan, the fat isn't going to get any higher than the beef itself started out (except for splattering), so if the beef itself all fits in with a bit of space at the top, you'll be fine. If it seems like you're cutting it close, split it into two batches.


Make sure also not to cover *too* tightly; you want steam to be able to escape. You want it to be covered well enough to keep fat from splattering everywhere, and to keep it from drying out fast and burning on the top or bottom, but you also don't want all the water to get stuck in there until it boils over.


Letting it cook in the fat is really just a personal preference. If you want the final result to be super lean and maybe a bit dry, don't do it; if you want to keep it moist and juicy and don't mind some fat, cooking it in the fat is good for it.

For food safety issues...


All that matters is what temperature the beef reaches. The [FDA recommends](http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/HealthEducators/ucm082294.htm) that it reach 160F. You don't really need a thermometer to check in this case, though: if it's all obviously brown it's fine.


So, yes, that general idea is probably safe, but I wouldn't try to pin the time down now. Just put it in the oven and check periodically until it's done. Exactly how long it takes will depend on how thick the beef is in the pan (i.e. how big the pan is).

34,Does chilli get milder with cooking?,"I have made a tomato, onion and cannelini bean curry. I put a lot of chilli spice in it, perhaps too much. If I keep simmering it, will it get milder? I'm hoping it will cook into the (bland) beans.


",<beans><chili-peppers><curry>,2016-10-14 13:19:06.693,74748,52,"You'll sometimes hear television cooking show hosts describe what they're doing as ""cooking out"" the paste. What they're actually doing is altering the flavor of the chili itself, *not* manipulating the level of capsaicin that was introduced. If you take a typical chili paste which has been combined with garlic and other things and then saute it in a fat, you will lower the level of heat that's tasted (and possibly take some bitterness out, depending on the chili and what's in the paste), but not lower the level that's actually ingested.


If you literally want to cook it out, put some sliced chili with nothing else in a *searing* hot pan, but make sure no one else is home or going to be home for a while, and wear a respirator. The capsaicin has nowhere to go and vaporizes as it burns (seriously, don't do that, if you did that in my kitchen I'd throw a live crab at you).


Various kinds of fat bond well with the capsaicin, essentially creating a sort of encasement. To demonstrate how this works, grab some sriracha and some cream. Mix in about half a tablespoon of sriracha to about 300 ml of cream, taste it. Now, simmer the cream a bit (about 3 - 5 minutes), take it off the heat, let it rest a few minutes and taste it again. The level of sriracha didn't change, what happened is the cream got its hands on the capsaicin that it contained. It'll continue to get milder the longer it sits. That's why a glass of milk can rescue you from atomic hot wings and why water just broadens the pain as it makes sure your *whole* palate gets a chance to taste it :) Beer just makes you care less about it.


Now, *sugar* has the remarkable quality of helping to hide heat with its mighty [right of first refusal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_first_refusal) when it comes to your palate. The heat from the chili shows up and your palate says ""*what? I'm too busy with this sweet, I can only listen to a little of you*"". To see how that works, repeat the experiment again, but this time throw a teaspoon or so of confectioner's (or castor) sugar into the cream with the sriracha, along with an additional squirt or two (around 10 ml) of sriracha. That's why coconut milk works so perfectly in a curry. 


The best bet for your recipe is finding a way to get some kind of fat into it. That could be coconut milk, fatty bacon, or whatever makes sense based on how you want to serve it. Then, optionally, sweeten it up a bit (also remember that citrus helps offset sweet, handy to keep that in mind when you're 'fixing' a dish) - some raisins sound like they'd work rather well with what you're doing. Maybe go with coconut milk and raisins, and thin it out with a bit of chicken stock if needed? 


I really try to encourage people to take an hour and just experiment with ways you can alter and *sort of* control chili, because it is a lovely thing to cook with. Just remember, whatever you put in the pan initially ends up being eaten, you're just hiding a bit of that as you cook.

6,Slow Cooker makes a mess,"I tried googling this one but I just kept getting recipes. 


I bought a slow cooker [(Proctor-Silex 33043 4-Quart Slow Cooker)](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B004O07LRC), which seemed to have good reviews. However I try to make stock, which I would normally cook for 12+ hours, every time that I do it bubbles over. It isn't to say that the liquid itself boils up and out of the pot but rather a ring of liquid forms on the edge of the pot and begins to bubble outwards.


It causes a mess by burning inside of the metal part of the pan (in-between the heating element and the stoneware part) and spilling down the outside walls of the slow cooker onto the counter.


What can I do about this? Is it just a bad slow cooker or is there a trick I'm missing. I haven't encountered this problem before with my old cooker or pot on the stove. I was considering inserting a toothpick in the edge or something.


Has anyone else encountered this? Is it because I'm making very liquid stock vs say a heavier dish like oatmeal? I've tried shallow (less liquid) and very full but it occurs in both scenarios.

6,"What is a pressurized filter, and should I use it for my espresso?","I've just started out really using my Gaggia Classic espresso machine, and so far I've been pretty satisfied with my results – but I'm no expert. Yesterday, I lost the black plastic thing that goes between the portafilter and the basket (is that the right terminology?), as shown below:


![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MHC4g.jpg)


Now, when I tried to make espresso without it, I noticed that the liquid would spray from the portafilter and, well, ruin my kitchen. When I researched further, it seemed that I didn't even use a normal filter, but something called a ""pressurized filter"", where there's only one hole in the bottom for the coffee to come out.


Here's what I found out about it [on coffeegeek.com](http://coffeegeek.com/opinions/markprince/07-20-2004#101):



> 
> […] a crema enhancing device is built into the actual filter basket, usually through the function of channeling all the brewed coffee through a solitary pin hole. This action creates a jet-like effect that boosts crema production, even in stale coffee or coarse ground coffee.
> 
> 
> 


People on the internet seem to hate this thing though, and I start wondering whether I should get a replacement for this bolt, or just buy a ""normal"" filter. Here are my questions:


* What exactly is the purpose of this ""enhancement""? How does it work?
* Why should I use it, or why shouldn't I? Does it matter for me as a non-professional?


",<coffee><espresso>,2012-01-08 17:08:01.963,20253,5,"This is called a pressurized portafilter. As you found on coffeegeek, it is designed to enhance production of crema. The Coffee Geeks look down on this device, since it produces what is essentially ""fake"" crema - even with old, stale pre-ground coffee.


If all you want to drink are lattes, it does not make much difference. If you want to taste decent espresso, then you must use a non-pressurized portafilter - even if you are a non-professional. 


Making espresso is not a slam dunk - especially with a consumer machine like the Gaggia. You will learn to improve your espresso shots by analyzing your technique. This often is based on the appearance of the crema during and after the shot is drawn. 


Since the pressurized portafilter gives you misleading information on the actual crema, you will have difficulty learning how to make a good espresso.

I don't have good ideas about the 10 and 11 o'clock modes, wavy lines without and with a fan - if Stephie is right in the comments and this is a combi oven, these are probably microwave modes. Else, it must be something producer specific.

2,problems with buttermilk biscuits,"I found the following recipe for buttermilk biscuits:


mix 2c flour, 1tsp salt, 1Tbsp baking soda
cut 6Tbsp cold butter into mix
add 1c buttermilk
pat and fold on floured surface, cut into round biscuits and put in oven


The first time I made it, I used plain white flour. The buttermilk made it wet, but not overly so - it became a very sticky dough.


I recently tried again, but this time I used spelt flour instead. The mixture was significantly ""wetter"" after adding the buttermilk - so much so that I added some (wheat) flour on top to try to get it to what the previous batch was like. They also didn't rise as much when baked.


What explains the difference? My theory is that spelt has less gluten, so the dough didn't hold the CO2 as well when baking. But does this also explain why the batter was so much ""wetter"" with the same quantities of flour and buttermilk?


",<baking><flour><quickbread>,2013-03-03 17:21:52.593,32394,5,"In quick breads, as opposed to yeast raised breads, it gelatinized starch that creates the structure of the bread, and holds the leavening.


However, according to my research, most spelt flour (which is in fact a variety of wheat) is whole grain flour, so the bran will interfere with structure development.


My quick research indicates that spelt flour recipes requires less liquid to hydrate than standard wheat flour. According to [What's Cooking America](http://whatscookingamerica.net/CharlotteBradley/Spelt-Flour.htm), this is because spelt flour is more water soluble than standard wheat flour (I interpret this to mean that the starches in it are).

But no matter how much pasta water I add, it never thickens the sauce.Yesterday I cooked one pound of pasta in a liter of water (which should yield extra thick pasta water) and the pasta water was still not nearly as thickening as a cornstarch slurry.


Is it over hyped, or is something wrong with me? 


* I use Barilla and DeCeCo pastas


",<sauce><pasta><italian-cuisine><thickening>,2017-01-05 10:54:00.200,77151,49,"You seem to have the wrong expectations. No, it will never be as thickening as a cornstarch slurry. If that's the level of thickening you expect, you are really better off using the slurry.


Don't forget that pasta water thickening is a traditional technique from the time when people did not go to the supermarket to buy a pack of cornstarch. They cooked down ripe tomatoes for several hours, and the starchy water saved from needing a few more hours of evaporation. Also, they cooked with homemade pasta, which had some flour residue sticking to it, not the perfectly-gelatinized industrial pastas we buy today.


If this is not how you cook, and if you prefer pudding-thick sauces, then the slurry is probably the better method for you.


I notice Kenji from Serious Eats has also tested pasta water and recommends it [for flavor reasons](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/05/does-pasta-water-really-make-difference.html). He also tested it for thickening - but against salted water, not against a slurry. That's what people mean by ""it thickens"" - it thickens when compared to random liquids, not when compared to thickeners.




---


There is also another thing that might have been meant in connection with ""pasta water for thickening sauce"". It is actually a very specific kind of sauce: an emulsion between pasta water and a liquid fat. There, you start with the pasta water, cook it down sufficiently, and stir in the fat into the hot pasta water. It produces a ""thick"" sauce - not as thick as, say, mayonnaise, but it is certainly thicker than the oil you are putting in, or than the pasta water itself. It may have been in this context that you have been hearing of ""pasta-water-thickened sauce"" and thought it meant that pasta water is a thickener for random styles of sauce.

My oven is relatively small (it looks like it can fit something up to about 15 inches x 18 inches) and we're looking to try something different for Thanksgiving this year. I suppose the oven should fit a half sized baking sheet in a pinch, but I don't own one.

I'm not sure if his recommendation is for a 1/2 sheet (13""x18""), or a 3/4 sheet (15""x21"") ... I know it's not for a 1/4 sheet.


As for cutting out the backbone -- shears would be the standard way, but for chicken I've often just gone in with a sharp knife and slowly cut through everything. It doesn't slice through easily, but if you keep one hand on the backbone to keep the chicken from moving, you can slowly saw your way through the ribs. (mind you, I've never tried on a turkey).


If you do get sheers, I like the ones that separate to clean and that have a little notch near the pivot to make sure bones don't slip as you cut them. The ones I have were sold as 'kitchen shears' not 'poultry sheers' (which are spring loaded (ie, more places to worry about gunks), and tend to be $70+, while my kitchen sheers were closer to $20).

5,What can I do to prolong vegetable and meat freshness in the freezer?,"In an effort to improve my eating habits I am thinking of buying more vegetables and meats while at the store so that I have them to cook with. However, with a busy schedule it is hard to try and find the time to cook something complex and needing to cut vegetables, meat, etc. I don't want to use frozen vegetables either, as I want to start actually cooking more and not re-heating frozen items.


If I pre-cut all the vegetables beforehand, how long will the vegetables stay fresh before losing flavor and getting soggy or drying out? Also, is there a preferable storage method, such as Ziploc bags, Tupperware containers, or glass bowls/containers with plastic wrap?


As for meat, is there a temperature that meats should be stored at in the freezer to keep them from getting freezer burn? Currently, it seems that whenever I put anything in my freezer, it forms ice crystals the next day. I've tried lowering the temperature dial in the freezer a number of times, but I am afraid that if I lower it too much then it won't freeze the food and it will spoil.


",<storage-method><meat><vegetables><storage-lifetime>,2012-04-12 19:20:36.037,22993,8,"For most vegetables, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to retain their quality once they have been cut. Your efforts would be much better spent either improving your cutting/chopping proficiency or in cooking entire meals ahead of time. Also, you could prepare components, such as sauteed onions or peppers, and maintain relatively high-quality versions of those.


Meat is a different story. You can do preparations in advance, and freeze individual portions for later use without degrading quality.


The best way to avoid freezer burn is to have a very cold freezer (ironically, easing the cooling settings on your freezer was having the opposite of your desired effect), and to prevent your food from coming in contact with air. You can use a freezer bag for each food item, making sure you squeeze all the air out of it first. However, if you are really serious about this, you would be well-served by investing in a vacuum sealer. Air is the big enemy here, so mechanically removing air from the system will greatly extend freezer life.

7,Which foods are certain to never cause food poisoning?,"After a nasty bout of food poisoning lasting nearly 5 days (rare I know) my trust levels and appetite for certain foods have dropped considerably however my inquisitiveness kicked in...


...from a data perspective (ignoring allergies) which foodstuffs are almost guaranteed or are actually guaranteed to never induce food poisoning in a human being? 


My first thought ran to protein powders mixed with certified-safe tap water.


I assume that all raw meat runs the possibility and all take-away or restaurant meals are discounted as well. I know fruit and vegetables fertilised with human manure in certain countries which potentially rules out fresh fruit and veg. 


Are there any foodstuffs guaranteed to be completely safe? Beef jerky perhaps due to the dehydrated nature? 


",<food-safety><food-science><food-preservation>,2015-01-31 16:34:30.460,54227,27,"There is almost no food which is guaranteed to be safe. If it has nutritional value for a human, it has nutritional value for many microorganisms too, some of which are human pathogens. 


So, out of the FATTOM rule, you can already throw out F: you cannot remove the food. A is also not a good candidate - no food is naturally acidic enough, and while there are foods preserved by acidity, an error in processing can lead to the food being dangerous. Also, there are some bacteria and molds which thrive in quite acidic environments (although few of them are pathogens). Oxygen is even worse, as botulinum is anaerobic and very dangerous. Also, once you open the canned food, it can get contaminated again. 


Time and temperature are quite good, but they are no guarantee for no food poisoning. First, processing errors are common. Second, you can't sterilize the food in a normal pot, and the remaining bacteria resume multiplying even before it's cooled off enough to eat. And, if it was contaminated before the cooking, the pathogens can have produced temperature stable toxins before you cooked the food. 


Moisture is probably the only factor which can produce completely safe food. Most dehydrated food is not 100% safe. Beef jerky, cured hams, dehydrated fruit, nuts and similar can easily grow toxic mold during improper storage. Depending on how much water was removed in the preservation process and where you live, the kitchen shelf can turn out to be ""improper storage"". Flours are quite safe too, but you have to cook them, and the cooked product is again not guaranteed to be safe. 


The only foods which will be completely safe will be the ones which never had any moisture to begin with, and will remain bactericidal if they acquire some moisture from the air. So sugar (either granulated, or hard candy),salt and pure oil can be declared safe from pathogens, but not from some kind of factory mishap where toxins can have contaminated the sugar and oil. A protein powder may fall in this category, I'm not completely sure how little moisture would be sufficient for a mold to grow on it. 


And don't forget that you can infect yourself with digestive tract pathogens by handling the food with contaminated utensils or fingers, even if they don't get the chance to build a colony in the food. You could in principle hold your dining room clean to operation room standards, but people get infections in operation rooms too. 


Nutrition is off topic for this site, so I won't discuss the wisdom of eating nothing but sugar, oil, salt and boiled water in order to eat guaranteed pathogen free food. For me personally, the trade off is absolutely not worth it.

4,Will colored shredded coconut show up in brownies?,"My coworkers would like me to make faux ""special"" brownies. The requirements are that the brownies look the part and still taste good but don't have any actual ""herbs"" in them. My first thought was crushed dried mint leaves. We also came up with colored coconut. I'm going to try the mint leaves, but will the food coloring hold up on the coconut in the brownies? Or would I be better off mixing undyed coconut into the brownie with some dyed coconut lightly mixed on top? Or are there any other suggestions I could use? I also thought of cat nip but that doesn't seem like it would taste good.

Update: I ended up making two brownies. 
One 8X8 pan with 6 bags of mint tea stirred into it. It gave off a very earthy (and minty) smell and has a very earthy/herby taste (and minty too). I doubt I'll make the mint ones again. 
The second one was a 9X13 pan with 2/3 of a bag of shredded coconut colored green. I put the coconut in a bowl and used gel food coloring. I don't have a huge selection of colors, so I used green with a touch of brown. I could have used a little more brown so the green wasn't so bright. I mixed it in the coconut and then mixed most of it into the batter. The remainder went on top and lightly swirled into the batter. The effect was really good and amazingly the color didn't seep into the brownies. When you bite into them, the coconut maintained its green color. I didn't have any white chocolate to try the green white chocolate idea, but maybe next time. :)

7,How do you prepare a fresh deer for cooking?,"I'll be getting a fresh deer, gutted by the hunter that shot it, but I need to prepare it myself.


I've heard that it's a good idea to let it hang for a day or two before skinning it, is that true?

",<skin>,2010-07-17 08:41:17.190,1443,3,"It's easiest to skin the deer when it's still warm, but since that isn't an option let it hang for a day or two, if the weather isn't going to get above around 40 degrees F. 


If this is your first time, definitely have a helper on hand to help you hold the deer. Have a hacksaw and a sharp knife on hand. A small electric knife/chainsaw is helpful but not necessary. Growing up, this is how we did it:


1. Peel the hide off (start from top, go to bottom).
2. Cut out the tenderloins with your knife.
3. Quarter the deer with the hacksaw and bring the quarters inside individually to cut further.


Be sure to look up some more videos/articles, but it's not too difficult. Have plenty of freezer bags and freezer space on hand. It helps to have a ""team"" cutting up the quarters...it's not hard but it's a lot of work.


Enjoy!

Edit:


I just read the vegetarian part of your question. I'm assuming you already know, but Parmesan isn't vegetarian, as it is made from rennet ([rennet is extracted from the lining of the inside of the stomach of mammals](http://www.fooducate.com/app#!page=post&id=57A33936-83D4-E661-409D-826437A4DF15)), and most commonly from the fourth stomach of young calves. The vegetarian substitutes I've tried in the past (Called pasta cheese), are not great. However, unlike Parmesan, Gruyere is allowed to be made with vegetable rennet and tastes great (I personally prefer it over Parmesan).

4,Silicone molds: transportation and storage,"I'm not quite sure if this is a proper question for this website, but I hope it is.
My question regards silicone molds you'd use in patisserie for baking (like cakes) or freezing (like mousses).


I am considering bringing back from a trip overseas some items, including silicone molds. However, I'm afraid if packing them in luggage or airplane travel could significantly damage the molds, for instance by leaving dents in them. Should I be worried? Are there any particular precautions I should take when transporting them? Of course, I understand they should be kept away from objects that could cut or tear them.


Since we're already here, I think I'll make the question a bit more general and ask about storage. Is there any care in particular one should take when storing them in order for them to keep their forms or otherwise quality?

9,Starters vs Entree,"I've been watching Hell's Kitchen USA and they have Starters/Appetisers, Entrees and Desserts. In Australia, we have Entree, Mains and Desserts, so its very confusing what Starters and Entrees are and what is the difference.

Can someone please explain their difference?


",<starter><cultural-difference>,2015-01-25 01:22:21.597,53955,11,"Entree in American English means main course, despite the original French meaning. 


This name is a sort of historical accident. Originally there were far more courses than just starters/appetizers, main course, and dessert. There have been a large variety of traditions, but a reasonably common meal structure was to have small appetizers (hors d'oeuvres), more substantial ones bordering on things you'd see as side dishes or half a main course now (entrées), then a large meat dish (plat principal, possibly). In North America the separate large meat dish disappeared from tradition over time, and effectively was folded into the entrées, and that name was retained for the main course.


Similar things happened elsewhere, of course - most people don't have four course meals all the time - but the resulting name is essentially unique to American English. In the rest of the English speaking world, the original terms largely remained.

4,Why does yoghurt need to feed on milk products? Why not plain sugar?,"My understanding is that yoghurt is is the biproduct of a yoghurt culture, a bacteria, eating lactose and excreting the yoghurt. 


My question is - why does it need to be lactose that the yoghurt culture is eating? 


For yeast to produce alcohol, for example, the yeast can eat any sugar, and it's up to the brewer to decide whether that's sucrose, corn, barley, grapes etc to affect the taste. 


Why is that that yoghurt cultures need lactose specifically?

These bacteria consume sugars and excrete lactic acid. The acid denatures the proteins in the milk, causing them to coagulate into a delicious gel.


Lactobacilli can consume sugars other than just lactose.


<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus>


The reason they eat lactose when making yogurt is because that's what they have. There is more than enough lactose in milk to make yogurt. There's no reason to add other sugars.


Lactobacilli are also responsible for the fermentation of pickles. In that case, even though they still produce lactic acid, they are consuming the sugars available in the vegetables, not lactose.

2. Whisk in flour, getting out all the lumps. (This is called a roux)
3. Continue to heat until smooth, and the roux is just starting to darken.
4. Remove pan from heat.


Step 2: Prepare Liquids


1. Remove solids from roasting pan. (let meat stand... etc.)
2. Whisk, scrape, deglaze the roasting pan. If it's brown, you want it, and want it dissolved

But if you should have problems with your hands or simply love all kinds of ""machinery"", the cookie press might be an option worth checking out. You can either ""pull the trigger"" for a pre-defined amount or unlock it and simply push the plunger.

7,How to make Chinese-style cornstarch coating stick,"The other day I prepared General Tso's Tofu. It tasted good, but the result was not quite what I wanted. Like with many other Chinese dishes, the tofu cubes in General Tso's Tofu are coated in a thin jelly-like layer consisting of cornstarch, liquid and seasoning. The coating is supposed to darken a bit, once it caramelizes in the hot pan. This adds a nice sweet-sour taste and appetizing gloss. (This is a nice [example](https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiy98G_hN_PAhWCMhoKHSDWAvcQFggeMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fminimalistbaker.com%2Fgeneral-tsos-tofu%2F&usg=AFQjCNGWy_e0-1YEoggIHOO-FEY67KB5lQ&sig2=ccbHLuTmMEGmBZKiS9It1A).)


The coating stuck well to the tofu cubes as long as they were raw. But once I had stirred the cubes in a hot pan, the coating came off the cubes and accumulated in lumps that eventually stuck to the spatula.


How can I prevent the coating from coming off the cubes while stir-frying? Is there a way to do this without deep-frying?


",<chinese-cuisine><tofu><cornstarch>,2016-10-16 09:52:56.670,74808,5,"The key in a stir-fry is that the ingedients can at all times move about freely. A spatula shouldn't really be needed, the way it is in sautéing, rather you use a spoon/ladle to just, well, *stir* the loose mixture. In fact even that isn't ideal: arguably, it should rather be called *toss-fry*, because vigorously moving the pan is the best way to keep everything apart, while minimising damage to items like coated tofu.


A proper wok is certainly the best utensil for doing this since its round shape keeps the tossed-up ingredients best from flying out of the pan. I don't actually have a wok, but I find non-stick aluminium pans to work well too, as they can be controlled easily and conduct heat quickly. (Purists will probably disagree here...)
  
At any rate I wouldn't care to do a stir-fry in a heavy traditional european cast-iron pan. Way too inert.


Apart from that, a couple of conditions are important to allow for easy enough movement:


* Not too much finely chopped material or viscous liquid should be in the pan, as both hinders movement.
* Nothing can be allowed to start sticking to the bottom.
* There needs to be sufficient heat, and enough heat transfer, so you actually get the cooking done quickly.
* Not too much water to absorb/vaporise away heat, at least at the beginning. Rather more than less oil helps though, but of course not as much as in deep-frying.


Again, all of this is clearly best accompished with a wok over an intense gas flame, but can also be done without.

3,Could adding oil to boil benefit the taste and texture of the pasta?,"**Note to mods**: this is not a duplicate. I am not concerned about pasta sticking.  
  

**Note to anyone who wants to stand on their heritage and say only their way is best**: I am Italian, I am 45, I have been cooking for my family for my entire adult life, as well as various jobs in food service.
  
  
  

A point of contention between myself and my wife is how we cook pasta. The main differences are: she adds a little oil to the water, I drizzle it in the colander after rinsing; she adds the salt to cold water, I add the salt after the water has boiled.


She prepared the pasta the other night. She had me finish to *al dente*. It was obvious to the eye that there was a bit of oil swirling in the water.


She hadn't prepared pasta in quite some time (I am a Fascist about some food prep). And since I haven't tasted it prepared her way in some time, I have to say: it was really good. The pasta (cavatappi) seemed softer somehow. I even had some the next day, after having sat in the fridge overnight. It was still very soft and flavorful.


I only rinsed the pasta (didn't also drizzle oil post-rinse). Putting the leftovers away after dinner, the pasta was not sticking terribly.


So, again, I know this is not the traditional way of preparing a pot of pasta. But I have to say, it was delicious.


I guess what I'm looking to find out is whether anyone has some science to back up why adding oil to the boil would improve taste and texture.


Thanks.


",<flavor><pasta><texture>,2017-04-21 13:44:30.557,81117,5,"It's very unlikely that adding oil is improving the taste or texture of the pasta, the amount people added is incidental to the process. Olive oil is mildly acidic, and if your water alkaline that acidity may neutralize it somewhat, however a tablespoon or two of oil in gallons of water is simply not enough to make a noticeable difference


What is likely to make a difference is salt, as seen in [this answer](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/2574/why-add-salt-to-the-water-when-cooking-pasta):

When you add the salt is immaterial as long as it dissolves in the water before you add the pasta.

3,How to Flavor Homemade Gum Drops,"For favors that I am making for an upcoming party, I'm looking to do some old-fashioned homemade gum drops. I have found [a recipe](http://www.grouprecipes.com/48760/homemade-gum-drops.html) that looks do-able. It calls for candy flavoring. I've also found other recipes that call for using [juice](http://homecooking.about.com/od/candyrecipes/r/bldes53.htm), which rather limits the flavors to the flavor of juice that I purchase.


In looking at my local stores, I cannot find anything in their online product lists indicating that they have candy flavoring, even those that carry Wilton products. I like the idea of candy flavoring for the variety, but am unsure about finding it.


**Are there pros and cons to using candy flavoring for gummy candy that I should be aware of** in making the decision of juice versus specific flavoring? **Are their alternate ways of flavoring** that I should be considering besides what I've seen in recipes so far?


",<flavor><candy>,2010-12-22 14:39:19.230,10578,3,"I would go for the juice if you are going for a fruit flavor.

9,Why use chopped tomatoes and tomato paste/puree?,"I have seen a number of recipes that call for a tin of chopped tomatoes *and* some quantity (usually a tablespoon or two) of tomato puree (USA: tomato paste).

",<tomatoes>,2010-11-27 11:19:31.227,9512,11,"Tomato puree is concentrated tomato. So where it is called for in conjunction with other tomato products, be they fresh or tinned, it is an attempt to increase the tomato flavour/presence in the dish without increasing the bulk or water inherent in less concentrated products.


Additionally the flavour of puree, having gone through a reduction process is somewhat different, more intense and rich than straight tomatoes.


Indeed, canned tomatoes tend to be surrounded with juice that is more reduced than would occur naturally. Which is part of why they are used against fresh tomatoes.

5,How should you saute in butter?,"Sauteing is pretty problematic for me with butter. It is difficult to find the sweet spot where you don't burn the butter but don't steam the veggies, and even then seldom I will not get a sizzle even thought I did not crowd the pan.


I know sauteing in butter may be a bad idea, but I like the flavor it gives to sauces, especially Marinara (and how can I make an Alfredo without sauteing mushrooms?? Ridiculous!)


Any methods for melting an sauteing in butter?


",<sauce><frying><temperature><butter><sauteing>,2016-03-14 18:54:19.970,67428,6,"Sauteing in butter is not really all that different from sauteing in any other oil: it just takes an awareness of the [smoke point](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/05/cooking-fats-101-whats-a-smoke-point-and-why-does-it-matter.html), and avoiding it. Consider investing in an IR thermometer that can tell you exactly the temperature of the pan (with or without the oil) so you can heat the pan to exactly the right point. For butter, that is about 350°F, which is not all that much lower than other oils - including EVOO, for example.


One suggestion is to do as the French do (who sauté in butter all the time!) and use [clarified butter](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/clarified-butter-recipe.html), which removes the solids from the butter. It's easy to do, and significantly raises the smoke point (as those solids start smoking much earlier than the oil does). Clarified butter has a smoke point of 450°F, as high as peanut oil. You don't even have to go to the extreme that the linked recipe does in clarifying; simply spooning out the bits you can easily see will often be sufficient. You can clarify butter and then refrigerate or freeze it, if you want to do it in large batches.


Second, use a pan that retains heat well - a heavier pan. That will allow you to cook at a lower temperature effectively. A thinner pan will have more hot spots, which lead to smoke sooner.


Third, make sure you're cooking the right amount of food in the right order. Don't crowd the pan too much. I've sauteed mushrooms and similar with no problem in butter; steaming shouldn't be an issue if you have the right amount of food in the pan at once. If you overload it, though, you do end up cooking too slowly and unevenly, and steaming or just mushing your food.


Fourth, salt is your friend when it comes to moisture. If you're cooking something very moist, salt it *before* cooking it (but after chopping it), give it a bit of time (5-10 minutes at least). This will let the salt remove some of the moisture, particularly from the outside. Then, wipe off the excess salt and the excess moisture with a cloth or paper towel before sauteing. (Don't give it a *long* time as eventually the moisture goes back in, and your food gets too salty.) This works well for me with things like eggplant or zucchini - remove some moisture, then saute - as well as the thicker mushrooms (like portobello or white mushrooms).

12,Why heat soup in a blender?,"Several times lately I have seen people recommend a particular brand of (very expensive) high powered blender.


Each time one of the main selling points for them is that the blender is so powerful that you can heat pureed soup in it.


Why would a person want to do this? It seems less efficient, more expensive, and more difficult to clean than using the stove or microwave.


",<soup><blender>,2012-02-01 15:32:21.710,20984,29,"I think you're misunderstanding the claim slightly. You do not heat an already pureed soup, you puree and heat in one step. You can indeed make a hot soup from cold ingredients using certain high end blenders. The only one I've verified this with is the vita-mix. To do this, you put your ingredients in to the blender, turn it on, and let it run about 5 minutes. The friction from the blades heats the soup while chopping the ingredients. The soup will get piping hot. 


Why would you do it? It's easy. It takes about 2 mins to get the soup really smooth, so it's 3 more minutes to get it hot. That's faster than you would be able to do with a stove, although maybe slower than a microwave. Is it more efficient? I don't know, but I doubt the difference in electrical efficiency is really sufficient to drive a choice one way or the other. 


In terms of cleaning, you already need to clean the blender because you pureed the soup. There's no additional cleaning to do if you cook it there too, versus additional cleaning for stove or microwave. And the blender is easy to clean as it's one piece; you just add soap and water and turn it on for 30 seconds, then rinse. 


Personally, I do not think this is ""one of the main selling points"". It's a neat trick, and it's useful. However, I think that it's more interesting as an indication of the blenders power. You can use these blenders to make exceptionally smooth soup, make peanut butter, properly crush ice for frozen drinks, etc. They do this much better than a 'normal' home blender, but just saying 'better' probably wouldn't sell a lot of these things at 4x the price, so they focus on something that the standard home blender most certainly cannot do.

",<onions><knife-skills>,2010-07-11 00:09:22.057,570,156,"The tearing of the eyes is a result of enzymes that form a sulpherous gas when the onion is cut (concentrated inside the inner core or bulb of the onion) being released into the surrounding air. 


You have a few options to avoid this - one would be to not cut through the center of the onion but to extract the ""core"". This is kind of a pain and means you are discarding a decent chunk of onion, so I don't like it too much. 


Another option is to use a fan to blow the gases away from you. A small fan next to you blowing horizontally should do the trick.


You could also wear goggles, although you'd have to leave them on for a while until the gas dissipates from the area.


Another technique is to cut a lemon in half and rub the fresh lemon against both sides of the blade. You'll have to keep ""refreshing"" the juice coat and your onions will have some lemon juice on them, so this is somewhat limited by that factor.

1,Are there ways in which you can overdo your thickening?,"In this [recipe](http://foodwishes.blogspot.co.il/2009/02/life-liberty-and-pursuit-of-cheesy.html) for mac and cheese that calls for a basic roux of 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup butter (60g from what I gathered it to be) I got a pretty thick sauce even after adding 3 cups of milk and before I added any type of cheese.


I wonder - can you do something in the roux-making that can cause the flour to over-thicken?


",<sauce><flour><thickening>,2016-04-13 13:08:06.160,68252,2,"Based on your description, it looks like you've made the common error of assuming that equal volume is equal weight.


Butter is more dense than flour so the same volume does not equal the same weight... you must convert the 1/4 cup for each product using a trustworthy site.


Here's one that [looks OK](http://dish.allrecipes.com/cup-to-gram-conversions/) and includes both butter and flour.


As you can see, 1/4 cup of butter is 57 grams. If you look at the next chart, you see the conversion for flour and you can see that 1/4 cup of flour is only 32 grams!


This means that, if you added 60 grams of each, you've got twice as much flour (the thickening agent) than the recipe calls for... so of course it's going to be way too thick.


I recommend you start over and be more careful with your conversions.


As a note, my standard recipe for Mac and Cheese uses 4 tbsp each of flour and butter (generally equivalent to 1/4 cup) while it only calls for two cups of milk rather than three, so I usually have a much thicker white sauce than yours will be and I find it quite enjoyable.


The [*Joy of Cooking*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joy_of_Cooking) (an iconic American cookbook) recipe calls for the same percentages for their white sauce - 2:2 tbsp of butter/flour with 1 cup of milk.

To answer your questions in the comments, pure butter (rather than spreadable butter/margarine or butter blends) in the US is usually sold in one pound boxes containing four sticks per box. Each stick is 1/4 pound of butter which is equivalent to 1/2 cup. Each stick is wrapped in waxed paper and has tick marks to show each tablespoon of butter for a total of eight tablespoons.


[![Sticks of Butter](https://i.stack.imgur.com/YDMB9.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/YDMB9.jpg)


Occasionally the paper isn't perfectly aligned but it's usually a simple matter to adjust your cut position to allow for the offset.


So, a cup of butter is two sticks, a 1/4 cup of butter is a half stick. and a tablespoon is 1/8th of a stick.




---


Your second question I think comes from a misunderstanding of how thick the white sauce is when completed correctly. With the proper percentages of flour and butter (and using two cups of milk), the final consistency you get is somewhere between thick cream-based soup and thin hummus. Adding the cheese usually doesn't effect the thickness because the cheese melts and is about the same consistency as the white sauce. I also like adding softer cheeses that melt well like goat cheese for both flavor and textural reasons.


Once baked, the final outcome will be fairly solid and casserole-like. You should be able to cut it with a knife and expect it to hold its shape to a good degree, like this:


[![Baked Macaroni and cheese](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DzRF8.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DzRF8.jpg)


This recipe will not make the creamy-style macaroni and cheese (an example is shown below. That is a different process and is generally not baked.

5,How can I make my kefir milk smooth and creamy instead of watery and grainy?,"Just started making kefir last week. My kefir comes out grainy and watery.


Here is what I'm doing:


* I have about 2 tablespoon of kefir
* I add about 4 cups of 2% organic milk
* Leave it for a day on the counter (26 degrees centigrade)
* It separates by this time (clear liquid at the bottom) but not much
* I run it through a plastic sieve.


The resulting kefir compared to store bought kefir (my only point of reference) is:


* seems watery instead of creamy
* seems grainy: tiny grains almost like yogurt particles
* has a sharp taste/smell


I still drink it and enjoy it. But I was wondering how I can improve it...

Update


I haven't gotten the timing right yet...however switching to whole milk is producing much better kefir.


",<milk><kefir>,2016-07-29 03:46:55.527,71746,6,"Most of the kefir recipes I saw online use whole milk, not low-fat milk as a starter. One source mentioned that commercial low-fat kefir recipes use large amounts of [additives and stabilizers](http://www.culturesforhealth.com/learn/milk-kefir/choosing-milk-making-dairy-kefir/) to make them thick. This might be related to your homemade kefir tasting watery, or being grainy, I don't know - but at least if you try and it doesn't solve the problem, you've eliminated one possible variable.


Another possibility is if your kefir is left too long, it will finish fermenting and start to separate. This stage, of beginning to separate into [curds and whey](http://www.culturesforhealth.com/learn/milk-kefir/how-to-make-milk-kefir/), might match your description of grains and clear liquid at the bottom of your container, though it perhaps hasn't curdled entirely yet. It may also explain the sharper taste, if the kefir has had enough time to ferment all the way through your milk. If your kefir was over-fermenting for whatever reason - perhaps it is sitting a little longer than it needs to, or if it's a little warmer then it might ferment faster, or something about [ratios or batch size](http://www.culturesforhealth.com/learn/milk-kefir/make-smaller-batches-less-milk-kefir/) - then stopping the ferment a little early (couple hours at a time?), straining out the grains and putting the kefir in the fridge, might get you the results you want.

13,"Some recipies call for beer to be added, but why?","I've seen some recipies that call for a can of beer to be added, but never have I seen them specify a specific kind or brand. That leads me to believe its less for flavor and more for chemical reaction.


My question: why is no type or brand specified? Is it left to the cook to decide what type/flavor beer would be best, or is it simply a chemical process that any beer can facilitate? If the latter, are there other ingredients which could be safely substituted?


",<beer>,2011-04-05 19:18:18.267,13778,15,"Beer, like wine or coffee, is often used when a reduction over a long cooking time is called for but water would be sub-optimal. I make chili a lot. Water is not your friend there, especially if you incorporate a lot of elements that have water in them to begin with (undried/roasted tomatoes in particular). Beer doesn't add the acidity that coffee does, but it is great for adding sugars and the maltier flavors. The sugars aren't precisely 'sweeter' but rather add depth of flavor.


I'd be interested in the effect of carbonation on the cooking process, however since carbonation is supposedly lost faster at higher temperatures I'd imagine it's less than expected.


Beer can be used to de-glaze and so on; its lower alcohol makes it much less reactive (than marsala or liquor) and the sugars make it as likely to glaze over. Still it imparts some flavor depending on the context.


The type of beer you should use is largely up to you. They differ greatly in flavor and composition. [For some suggestions on pairings check out this question.](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/8588/15) Another consideration is to look into Cicerones; it's a certification people get where (more for large scale operations than restaurants or personal use), in addition to knowledge of processing and manufacturing, [they are sommeliers of beer](http://www.cicerone.org/). 


An additional consideration is how long the beer will be cooking down. The longer the cook down, the more the flavors will be less distinct. However, there are flavors that are frequently only found in beer; hoppiness, roasted malt, and (the effects of open fermentation with) wild yeast can do amazing things in a dish. Creating a side reduction minimizes the cook down and can preserve the flavors.

The only time it might matter, is if you were trying to warm something up in the sun. Then it might make a difference.

It’s both a honey substitute (it does resemble fir honey) and a folk medicine against colds and coughing.

5,Is there a reason to have a plastic bowl?,"The only mixing bowl I have for now is a plastic one. But recently it came to my mind that I should have bought a stainless one instead. Is there any pros of plastic bowls, or some task that's best done with plastic bowls?


",<equipment>,2012-03-03 05:27:46.593,21952,6,"For your average mixing task, pretty much any bowl (of the right size, shape) will do. Also, ""plastic"" isn't one material, it's a bunch of different materials. For example, some advantages of polypropylene bowls do not apply to melamine formaldehyde bowls, but both are plastic.


So, here are some advantages of a polypropylene (PP) bowl over a metal bowl:


* microwave safe
* high elasticity (can be bent, and will go back to its original shape. E.g., if you drop your PP bowl, it won't dent)
* extremely acid-resistant
* extremely resistant to other chemical attacks (e.g., will not corrode)
* plastic bowls are often made in a mold, so can be cheaply made in a variety of shapes. You can get bowls with nice pouring spouts, etc. because of this.


Of course, they have disadvantages too:


* fats stick, almost impossible to remove all traces (a problem when beating egg whites)
* can't be used over a pot as a double-boiler
* can't hold very hot things (e.g., you can put hot oil in a metal bowl, but PP would melt. Different plastics have different melting points, some can't even hold boiling water. You never have to worry with stainless.)
* can't be used in the oven


And there are things which are just different, like metal conducts heat better (so it works better when cooling in an ice bath, but also you're much more likely to get burnt on it), metal is denser (PP floats, metal doesn't).


If you get metal bowls, except for a few applications where copper is nice (those egg whites, again), you want stainless steel. Stainless is fairly resistant to acid and also corrosion (plain steel is not). Note that stainless comes in different grades, which vary in their corrosion, rust, and acid resistance.

5,Lime substitute for nixtamalizing corn,"I want to have a go at [nixtamalizing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixtamalization) some corn. Upon doing some research I figured I could find the lime (calcium hydroxide) that's traditionally used for the process at the local international food market. Turns out all they sold was something called ['carbonato'](http://www.disruptit.com/upc_code/?CFGRIDKEY=0707425900440), which I'm pretty sure is just calcium carbonate. The lady at the store *did* tell me that people often buy it for boiling/processing corn, but I know enough food chemistry to know they wont' do the same thing. A similar search of the three big grocery stores in town for the lime turned up nothing.


So I thought I might be able to devise a substitution based on things I have on hand. I read you can [make something similar to nixtamal](http://www.motherearthnews.com/real-food/how-to-make-hominy-corn-zebz1305znsp.aspx) with food-grade sodium hydroxide, (which I happen to have in abundance) but according to that recipe, when made with sodium hydroxide in place of calcium hydroxide, the flavor *""has the bite of soda, and it lacks the rich corn chip fragrance of corn steeped in slacked [sic] lime""*.


My question is: before I go ahead and order some lime online, is there a possibility that a mixture of sodium hydroxide and some form of soluble calcium could give me the same or similar results (alkalinity **and** the right flavor) as lime? I have calcium sulfate and calcium chloride on hand, which will readily supply calcium in solution, and could easily pick up calcium carbonate. 


My (very basic) chemical understanding is that, in solution, **sodium hydroxide + calcium chloride** would be roughly analogous to **calcium hydroxide + sodium chloride**, since they provide the same ions and are all soluble. 


Could anyone weight in on this? Could this possibly be better aimed at the [Chemistry SE](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/)?


",<substitutions><dough><food-science>,2015-03-28 14:56:27.530,56181,6,"At least in theory what you're proposing should work, however I wouldn't mix sodium hydroxide, calcium chloride, water and corn all in one pot as you seem to be suggesting. I'm not chemistry expert, but as I understand it sodium hydroxide and calcium chloride react easily when dissolved in water to form calcium hydroxide and sodium chloride. Having corn in the mix won't help the process so you'd be better off doing it as a separate step. Since calcium hydroxide doesn't dissolve in water very well, most of it will precipitate out making it fairly easy to separate out. Doing it this way you can make sure the sodium hydroxide doesn't end up reacting with the corn instead of the calcium chloride.


However making calcium chloride a home is something I've never tried myself, and I doubt anyone else here has either. There could easily be important considerations that I'm not aware of.
So it probably would be a good idea to ask on Chemistry Stack Exchange about how to best go about producing calcium hydroxide from sodium hydroxide and calcium chloride. That is, assuming such a question is on-topic there, though from a quick check it looks like it should be.


There is however one important consideration that I can mention, one that I'm sure you already aware of, and that's the fact sodium hydroxide (aka caustic soda) is a pretty dangerous chemical. For that reason alone, I think Rick's answer is the correct one. Just buy food grade calcium hydroxide. When sold as pickling lime it's not at all hard to find online. During the fall you might be able it in local stores sold along with other seasonal canning-related goods. Another possible local source might be an aquarium store or club, as [food grade calcium hydroxide is apparently used by aquarium owners](http://www.reefkeeping.com/issues/2005-01/rhf/#2) as a cheaper substitute for aquarium specific products.

2,When and how much flour do I add when mixing dough?,"I am a rookie bread baker and I have been following some recipes that range in amounts of water and flour. I have a Kitchenaid artisan mixer that has been doing the hard work of kneading for me. My problem is knowing when to stop adding flour during mixing/kneading.


Some recipes say add flour until the dough is workable and then knead. My questions is, when they say use 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 cups of flour but no more. How do I know when to stop, I have ruined a few loaves as they came out heavy and dense.


How do I know when to stop adding flour and let the gluten take care of the stickiness? I often find myself adding flour until the dough balls up and pulls from the sides but by then it's too late.


On the other side, I have kneaded for 15 - 20 minutes waiting for the dough to pull sides of the bowl and it never happened.


When do I add flour and when do I just wait?


Any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated!


",<bread><flour><mixing><kneading>,2017-03-18 23:41:38.193,79245,3,"I'll convert my comment into an answer, based on your request for help or suggestions. Bread formulas are created using the ""Baker's Percentage Method"". It is expressed in the amount of liquid in ratio to the amount of flour. This percentage varies according to the style of bread, but within each style produces accurate results when using weight measurement. 


Using volumetric measurement, especially for flour, is highly inaccurate because many variables can influence how much flour fits into a measuring cup (grind, humidity, compaction...etc). That is why these kinds of recipes often suggest a range, and put the baker in the position of guessing.


Using a scale, and weighing your ingredients according to the baker's percentage of a recipe, removes the guess work.

14,How much salt should I add to a dish?,"I find it hard to figure out how much salt to add to dishes. I'm always afraid I'll make it too salty. Recipes always call for salt to taste, but what does that mean? Is there a good rule of thumb?


",<flavor><salt><spices>,2010-07-10 22:44:06.617,563,17,"I've noticed that salty food has somewhat of an addictive quality; people who eat a lot of it (i.e. fast food or other processed food) tend to bury their meals under a mountain of salt, whereas people such as myself who do a lot of home cooking hardly use (or want) any.


""Season to taste"" means pretty much what it sounds like; add however much salt (and other spices) that you, personally, like the taste of. If you have a habit of eating a lot of salty foods, then you might want to add a little less than that, for the benefit of people like me who gag at heavily-salted foods.


If you use a lot of other spices, you won't need much salt - a few shakes of the shaker is enough. If the food is basically bland aside from the salt (and maybe pepper), then you'll need to use more. The best thing to do is add a little, then taste, and repeat as many times as it takes to get the flavour you want. If the food you're seasoning is still raw (and can't be eaten raw), then just put in a small amount the first time you make it and keep track of how much table salt you needed to add.


Just remember, you can always add salt later, but a dish that's *too* salty is permanently ruined.

1,Can't get beans to cook to tender,"I’m having a horrible time trying to get beans cooked to be tender and not bitter. Overnight soaking and rapid soak methods aren’t making any difference. If I add anything to the cooking process, it’s a piece of onion and/or a hot green chili. These beans soak for at least 10 hours and cook for over 4! 


Ok, so maybe at my store, the beans are old. The packages are never past the pull date. How do you tell just by looking whether they’re “too old”?


",<beans>,2018-11-05 04:20:00.377,93643,5,"There are three primary reasons why dried beans do not soften despite extensive cooking time: 1) they are old; 2) hard water; or 3) the presence of an acid. 


If you don't think your beans are old, then perhaps your water is the problem. Beans cooked in hard water will never soften properly. If this might be your case, try cooking them in distilled water instead. That should help. It doesn't sound like acidity is a problem, given what you described. 


For cooking advice, I often look to Christopher Kimball of America's Test Kitchen. His group does extensive testing of all sorts of recipes and cooking techniques. Here is an excerpt from his blog on dried beans: 


""Troubleshooting Hard Beans


Finally, if you’ve cooked your beans for hours and found they failed to soften, chances are they are either old and stale (and will never fully hydrate or soften), the water is too hard, or there’s a acidic element present. Food scientists universally agree that high acidity can interfere with the softening of the cellulose-based bean cells, causing them to remain hard no matter how long they cook. Alkalinity, on the other hand, has the opposite effect on legumes. Alkalines make the bean starches more soluble and thus cause the beans to cook faster. (Older bean recipes often included a pinch of baking soda for its alkalinity, but because baking soda has been shown to destroy valuable nutrients, few contemporary recipes suggest this shortcut.)""

3,Is there ever a reason not to use baking beads when blind baking?,"Whenever I'm making a recipe that calls for blind baking pastry, they always provide alternatives for ceramic baking beads (such as rice) in case you don't own any. I do own them, so I always use them, assuming that they are the best choice.


Considering that they are specifically designed for blind baking, my question is: are there any disadvantages to using baking beads, or if I own them should I always choose to use them over other things for weighing down the pastry? Are there any alternatives that will give better results?


",<baking><pastry><blind-baking>,2017-11-23 10:53:25.130,85883,1,"There is no reason to use something else, except that you either don't have pie weights (another name for ceramic baking beads), or you don't have enough of them.


Most Americans don't have pie weights in the kitchen. Even those who do, often have a single chain of them, sufficient to cover the bottom of a pie crust but not to fill it. Certain preparations, such as blind-baking a butter crust, require filling the pie crust to the rim in order to deter slumping, which could require as much as 5 cups of weights.


So if you don't have any, or don't have enough, use rice/beans/spare change.


COUNTERPOINT: Stella Parks makes a good case why you should use sugar in preference to pie weights in [her article on blind-baking](http://www.seriouseats.com/2016/10/how-to-blind-bake-a-pie-crust.html).

3,How to fix a sauce that is too sweet?,"A while ago I attempted to make the Better than [Olive Garden Alfredo Sauce](http://www.food.com/recipe/better-than-olive-garden-alfredo-sauce-141983) from food.com.
One of the ingredients it calls for is heavy cream and as I live in Canada where they don't sell heavy cream I decided to substitute it for equal amounts whipping cream. The other ingredients called for are sweet butter (I used unsalted butter), minced garlic cloves, white pepper, grated parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese and pasta.


The finished sauce was way to sweet and we didn't finish our plates let alone keep the leftovers. The only sweet ingredient I can see is the heavy cream so I am guessing the problem lies with that ingredient so I ask... Did I substitute the right ingredient for the heavy cream? Should I have changed the portions? What do you recommend.


",<substitutions><sauce><cream><alfredo>,2010-11-02 15:12:02.330,8769,4,"Unless there was sugar in your cream, there's nothing particularly sweet about this combination. Did you salt the pasta water to roughly seawater saltiness? If not, did you adjust salt before serving? If your pasta water was under-salted, that would explain the sweetness, since the only significant source of salt otherwise was the parmesan.


Heavy cream is equivalent to 36-40% whipping cream.


In the event that your cream was pre-sweetened, there's not much you could do except add salt and hope the sugar doesn't overwhelm. It's a fairly common technique to add sugar to a salty dish to make it taste richer, or salt to a sweet dish for a similar purpose. But it wouldn't work very well if the cream was very sweet. Since I've never seen sweetened whipped cream except in aerosol dispensers, I can't say for sure.

3,How to achieve a good steak crust with a blowtorch?,"I tried to torch sous vide steaks twice with a culinary blow torch, but it seems to take forever to get any kind of crust. So far I was not able to achive a really good crust. Should I simply do it longer? The following result took me several minutes per side:


[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xsAbC.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xsAbC.jpg)


Granted, I don't notice much of a gradient, so I suppose, that even if it takes a long time, it probably doesn't affect the interior temperature too much. Still I am not sure, how it is even possible to achieve a decent crust with this method. And I am also confused, why would this take longer, considering that the temperature of the torch is a lot hotter, than a cast iron.


",<steak><crust><searing><blowtorch>,2019-03-29 21:17:13.873,97235,3,"It does take a couple of minutes to get a good crust with a torch, but judging by that photo something went wrong as there’s little crust on that picture.


As aris mentioned, you need to ensure that there is no moisture on the steak.
You mentioned adding butter on top and letting it melt at room temperature. This could act as a barrier for the heat but no kitchen test I know of tackled this specifically. Next time try without as I’ve always gotten and seen good results without butter on it.


Lastly, keep the torch at a moderate distance and linger slightly on a spot until you see some sizzling. Make small circles, but don’t move the torch all over rapidly. You don’t need to distribute the heat evenly while trying to get a crust.

10,Will meat cook inside of a rice cooker?,"I would like to use my rice cooker to cook one of those pre-packaged jambalaya mixes, and I've had good success with using prepackaged rice packets in my rice cooker. Sometimes there is a bit of sticking on the bottom but it comes right up and is never that bad.


My question is if it's safe to throw uncooked meat inside of the rice cooker. I'm talking about average sized chunks, but can cut them smaller to make sure they cook through.


Since water boils at 212°F, and the contents of the cooker are kept warm afterwards, I'm guessing that any meat you put in there (granted its cut thin enough) will cook straight through.


To be more specific, in this instance I am thinking about throwing cubes of deer venison which require *much* less cooking than say pork or poultry. 


",<food-safety><meat><boiling><rice-cooker>,2012-01-21 18:16:53.000,21093,9,"Anything will cook in a rice cooker, eventually. You will need to experiment with the size of the meat chunks. When the meal is done cooking, take them out and see if they are cooked and at the correct temperature. If not, finish cooking them and cut them up smaller next time.


What I would do however is cube the meat, sear it, and then throw it in to the cooker. You will end up with a better texture this way.

7,How do I know if my cast iron dutch oven is preseasoned?,"So I bought a cast iron dutch oven. It doesn't say anything on the box about it being preseasoned or not. So I looked up some guides online to see if there was anything special I needed to do before using it, and I found [this page](http://www.dutchovenmania.com/seasoning-cast-iron.html) which says:



> 
> If not pre-seasoned, the first thing you’ll notice is your new Dutch oven will be coated with a thick layer of wax. 
> 
> 
> 


This is weird because I don't notice any kind of wax on my Dutch oven. It's a dark black and is slightly shiny. I expected that if it was already seasoned it would probably say so on the box, or am I wrong?


What is the wax supposed to look like? How do I know if mine is seasoned or not?


",<dutch-oven>,2012-10-14 17:43:10.213,27806,7,"You would know if the dutch oven was covered in wax. Cast iron prior to seasoning is a light grey color. It will rust very quickly just from atmospheric moisture, so they cover it in paraffin wax to preserve it. The process of seasoning the utensil forms a tough, yet smooth, black coating of polymerized oil. If your dutch oven is a slightly shiny dark black, it is safe to say that it has already been seasoned. With the proper care your dutch oven will last you many lifetimes-- enjoy it!

0,How can I add flavor to green tea at home?,"I often buy green tea with different flavors like lemon, strawberry, and jasmine from the market. I want to add these flavors at home. Can you recommend how I might do this?


",<flavor><tea>,2018-11-09 16:10:23.537,93749,1,"Depends on the flavour I suppose. For the most direct route, I would try just steeping the fruit/flavour in the tea/water for a bit (ie: sliced strawberry, sliced ginger, lemon zest/peel, etc...). I make a ginger/lemon ""tea"" with thin slices of lemon zest by just steeping it in water. No reason you couldn't add some green tea leaves to that as well. Lemon Juice, I add before serving.


As mentioned finding an extract could work as well. No idea about amounts, you'll have to do some research as to what is safe/appropriate. I haven't used them.


For a Jasmine Tea, I would probably just find a good tea purveyor and find a proper Jasmine Tea.

8,Can you freeze waffle batter?,"We have made too much waffle batter. The recipe includes flour, baking powder, salt, eggs and milk (no fat), and part of the instructions are to beat the eggs until frothy - we're assuming this is to encorporate air into the mixture.


Can we freeze half of the batter, and if so, will we need to do anything to it when we come to use it (i.e. beating it to re-encorporate air)?


",<freezing><waffle>,2010-10-30 08:56:43.667,8682,5,"[StillTasty](http://www.stilltasty.com/fooditems/index/17861) says you can safely store waffle batter for 3 months, but I've had bad luck freezing it as far as quality goes. After thawing and cooking the batter, the waffles didn't really ""rise"" enough to be worthwhile. They tasted ok, but the texture wasn't nearly what I wanted.


Waffles are essentially a [quick bread](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_bread), and I believe the baking powder doesn't have the same effect after freezing. I do know that you lose the frothy goodness that you get from the whisking/beating, which is important in achieving the light, fluffy lift inside the crispy exterior. I was told that if you use a yeast recipe instead of a baking powder recipe, you can thaw it overnight and it will give the yeast time to activate by morning - unfortunately I haven't tried it so I'm only passing it on as a suggestion.


What I've found works:


* Making a bunch of waffles and freezing them between layers of wax paper. Not as good as fresh, but better than store-bought frozen, and very convenient.
* Storing the dry mix in the pantry (short-term) or freezer (longer-term), as I generally have milk and eggs on hand and have time for a quick whisk. Not as convenient or portable, but tastier. If you modify the recipe using evaporated milk or dried buttermilk, you can make them with water and egg instead of milk and egg.


As a side note, you probably have about 3 days in the fridge.

7,What differences are there between Chia and Flax Eggs?,"In substituting Flax Eggs (milled/ground flax seeds in a water slurry, after they congeal) for regular eggs, I have found them to be a versatile aide in baking and thickening any number of dishes. 


I have begun to hear tell of using chia seeds instead of flax or something like Ener-G egg replacer. Can chia be used in the same fashion once the seeds are ground as flax? 


* Is the chia composition the same as a flax egg (1 part milled flax seed to 3 parts water, in slurry)?
* Do they set the same, i.e. congeal in the same time?
* Can they be mixed for super supplement-y egg substitutes?
* What differences are there in how you make or use them, and which is preferred for different uses (if either)?


",<eggs><vegetarian><vegan><flax><chia>,2012-02-16 17:18:26.027,23876,6,"With flax seeds I like using 1T of seed (ends up being 2.5T of powder) to 3T of water, and use it for thing that are suppose to be light like cake or something that needs a nutty flavor.


But with chia seeds I use exactly 1T of powder to 3T of water (ends up looking like egg whites) and use it in brownies, cookies and so on. Also chia doesn't add flavor like flax does.


\*\*For me chia is definitely stronger.


The first time I used a chia egg I thought it was like a flax (1T seed = 2.5T powder) but I was wrong, my baked good came out very dense in the middle and tasted raw. You can still use a chia but you have to be exact.


Also a chia egg will become very thick and gloppy once it's mixed with water whereas a flax just get gooey.

3,How long to sous vide a tough cut of steak?,"With most steaks the recommended cooking time in sous vide is about an hour (of course depending on the thickness of the cut).


I have done some sous vide cooks recently, and they always ended up perfect until last time, where I had a ribeye, which turned out tough and chewy.


I have since learned, that ribeye in particular has some connective tissue, which can make it tough. I have also learned, that most tenderizing methods, like vinegar or baking soda don't actually really work, because they are only in contact with the meat on the outside.


So I was wondering if I could improve the result, if I simply increase the cooking time to say 2h? Or should it be way longer than that in order to tenderize the connective tissue?


What would be the downside of increasing the cooking time?


",<steak><sous-vide><tenderizing>,2019-04-07 20:19:22.963,97375,3,"Collagen (type-1, for the scientific folks), one of the major connective tissues in beef, begins to dissolve into gelatin starting at 55°C (131°F) but very slowly, long enough for the meat itself to become mush. The pace increases with rising temperature to about 71°C (160°F), at which point further rises in temperature don't accelerate the process much -- but that would be medium-well, a crime for ribeye. Unfortunately, collagen begins to denature at 68°C (154°F), which is also when the meat begins to constrict/toughen substantially and release lots of its juices. [Cooks Illustrated](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/10195-sous-vide-butter-basted-thick-cut-rib-eye-steaks?incode=MCSCD00L0&ref=new_search_experience_1) suggests 54°C/130°F for 2-3 hours, but in my steak that didn't melt the collagen at all. I find the best trade-off is medium, 63-64°C (145-147°F) for 3 hours. Yes, it isn't the deep rosy and extra-tender medium rare, but most of the connective tissue vanishes and is replaced with luscious gelatin.

10,How can I safely reuse tea?,"I regularly reuse my tea bags, sometimes over as much as a five hour span. 


I am sure that there are limits to the safe re-use of tea, but I can't find any USDA or other authoritative guidance. 


What are reasonable precautions I can take to ensure that I am not putting myself at risk for foodborne illness?


Please provide evidence-based answers, not anecdotal reports. I don't mind if the answers are somewhat speculative based on evidence from analogous food preparations.


",<food-safety><tea><beverages>,2012-11-07 20:30:02.753,28317,8,"The issue here is how long do you steep the tea, at what temperature, and under what conditions do you store the used tea bags? The reason ""sun tea"" has been discouraged has been because of the likelihood that the tea leaves that are in the bags are contaminated with bacteria such that a long soak in luke-warm water such as that of the ""sun tea"" causes them to multiply to the extent that they become a serious health risk. Tea leaves are not typically pasteurized during their processing, and may carry viable bacteria and/ or bacterial spores.


If you were to soak the tea bag in warm water not hot enough to get a good bacterial kill initially, there may be enough viable bacteria in the tea leaves to grow during that 5 hour interval such that the next cup may be seriously dangerous (some may divide every 15 minutes, for example). However, if you were to adequately kill the bacteria and spores off by a nice hot soak (for this example, you would need to use a pressure cooker since some bacterial spores are not even killed by boiling water at atmospheric pressure), refrigerate the tea bag afterwards, and then reuse it 5 hours later it would likely be perfectly fine.


I think the final answer to your question comes down to your own personal risk tolerance and the conditions above. If you brew in luke-warm water or for a very brief time and then leave the bags out at room temperature you are just asking for trouble and eventually you may hit the loaded chamber in your own personal Russian roulette game.


For empiric answers, take your particular brewing temperature and time and compare it to the USDA tables for pasteurization. Then, look up the growth curves for the major pathogens at your storage temperature and figure out how many would likely be present after 5 hours (20 generations at 15 minutes per generation or 2^20 times more bacteria than viable after the brewing event at the end of the storage interval).

0,Why doesn't deep frying 'wet' the food?,"If I placed bread crumbs in a pot of oil to deep fry and then take it out, it comes out crispy and not 'wet', although they are drenched in oil initially?


But if I place bread crumbs in boiling water, they just stay soaked?


",<deep-frying>,2015-02-23 07:25:27.790,55038,9,"Firstly I think you're having trouble making a distinguishment between water and oil absorption. Even though placing food in (room temp) oil may at first seem as if it had gotten it *'wet'* it's a very different kind of *soaked* compared to doing the same thing with water, as the two liquids have profoundly different properties.


Oil when heated, however, behaves even more differently. The immense heat of the oil (160-270 ºC, 320-520 ºF depending on the type of oil you are using) actually vaporises moisture (water) contained inside of whatever it may be you are deep frying, which is why food thermally processed in this way is oily but **not** wet, and can even be dry if overcooked.


The key thing to remember here is that oils, being hydrophobic and lipophilic, are exceptionally different to water and should not and cannot be expected to behave even remotely similarly.

Cut the cake in half (vertically), get a big needle like a darning needle or something similar, and (carefully) thread a few laces through, cutting them off flush with the surface, then stick the cake back together with icing or jam and pipe on the outer icing. The tricky thing will be getting them to follow curvy paths.


The other thing you could do is use said needle (or perhaps a chopstick) to poke little tunnels through the cake, then pipe red jam into them. This would perhaps give a nicer result - it might be a bit odd to be eating a slice of cake and then to suddenly be chewing a rubbery bootlace.

8,How do I calculate the final acidity of homemade vinegar?,"I am making vinegar by mixing vinegar (containing the mother) and wine, and then allowing fermentation to occur. I am wondering how to calculate the final % acidity. 


**Assume:**


1. I know the initial concentration (by volume) of acetic acid, `X`, alcohol `Y`
2. All alcohol will be converted to acetic acid
3. No sugar is converted to acetic acid


How do I calculate the final acidity?


",<vinegar><fermentation><chemistry>,2012-06-16 01:21:18.747,24530,8,"This is actually a great chemistry question! First off, you need the density and molecular weight of the acetic acid (1.039 g/mL, 60.05 g/mol) and alcohol (which is ethanol — 0.709 g/mL, 46.07 g/mol). Assuming 100% conversion of ethanol (y) to acetic acid (x), you will end up with the same number of moles of acetic acid as the amount of ethanol you started with.


So if you started with y mL ethanol, you would have 0.709/(46.07 \* y) moles ethanol.


Since we are assuming 100% conversion to acetic acid, we end with the same number of moles acetic acid, which we can then convert back to mL. mL acetic acid = 60.05/(moles acetic acid/ethanol \* 1.049).


If we condense all that into one calculation, you end up with: mL acetic acid = 1.753 \* mL ethanol.


If you add the volume of acetic acid you made in the fermentation process and the amount you started with, you have the total volume of acetic acid in your vinegar. Simply divide this by the total volume of vinegar to get the % acetic acid!

0,Shelf life of homemade self-rising flour?,"I have a recipe that uses self-rising flour which is not available where I live, so I make my own by sifting all-purpose flour, baking powder and salt together. This has always worked fine.


In a few days I will be needing a few cups, so I decided to make it today and store it in a closed plastic bag.


***Could it be a problem that I have made the flour a few days in advance? Will it still work as expected?***


I have always used the homemade self-rising flour immediately and never tried to store it.


Of course the self-rising flour you buy in stores are the same three ingredients, but I don't know if the manufacture also uses some additives that makes it store well. 


",<baking><flour><baking-powder>,2019-03-12 06:42:06.917,96873,4,"The shelf life is not a problem. This is one of the rare cases where mixing ingredients doesn't change their shelf life. All of them are shelf stable because of lack of moisture, and nothing is introducing moisture, so the mixture is shelf stable. 


You could, however, run into problems if you try to make a large batch and scoop out of it for every baking session. The reason is that this kind of mixture rarely stays homogenous. Every shake encourages it to separate, with the larger grains (salt, baking powder) gathering on top of the smaller grains (flour). If you store it somewhere undisturbed, the effect won't be too strong the first few times you use it, but you will be on the safe side if you pre-mix the quantity for exactly one batch only. 


As a side note, this seems like a strange way to go about it. If you either don't premix and just pour all ingredients into the bowl on baking day, or premix all dry ingredients at once (making your own baking mix, so to speak) you will be more efficient than just mixing a self rising flour separately.

This results in a very rich sauce which is delightful in its own right. I'm concerned that I might be make a sauce that covers up this glorious beef.


Does anyone have any recommendations for my first time?


Things I'm particularly concerned with are:


* What wine to use in the sauce - is high-end/vintage wine important, and what varieties might be best?
* Should I seek out something a little more upscale than reduced Swanson beef broth?
* Is this cut generally served sauced or unsauced?


",<sauce><steak><sous-vide>,2012-01-20 15:08:36.273,20646,4,"This sounds yummy! 


I'd recommend cooking sous vide (SV) as you suggest (130 F for 1-3 hrs). I tend not to season in the SV bag at all because salt & spices often turn out oddly; for example, raw herbs/onion/garlic are far stronger and taste ""uncooked"". Figuring out how to spice SV takes a fair amount of experimentation and is best done with dried & powdered herbs/spices instead of fresh ones. 


VERY IMPORTANT:


* Before cooking SV trim excess fat from the steak
* After cooking take the meat from the SV bag and DRY it thoroughly before searing!
* If you're planning to use bag juices, first bring them to a full boil in another pot and skim off the scum (myoglobin ""blood""), then use whatever is left as your meat juice.


To sear, pre-heat the cast iron sear to a very high temperature (~500) and use a high-temperature oil like peanut. 


The sear should be at VERY high heat for only 30 seconds or so per side - if you leave it on much longer you'll lose the beautiful 130 degree edge-to-edge miracle that should be your reward. 


Using butter for the sear is not a good idea as either the butter will be destroyed by the properly high heat OR the steak will be destroyed by keeping the cast iron's heat low enough for the butter. Rather, use compound butter as a topper for presentation.


As for using a torch, I've used a brulee torch a few times and the heat & coverage is insufficient to sear a steak well with my limited experience. You can sign your name on the steak with it, but getting a good, even edge-to-edge Maillard crust is very tough. Using a MAPP torch is quite a bit better; MAPP gas is flavorless, it's hotter than propane or butane, and MAPP torches tend to fan out broader flames, but I still don't think they create as dense or flavorful a crust as a pan-sear. Moreover ANY torch runs a likelihood of flat-out burning areas of the meat, and that's especially true for a first-timer!


Let's talk about salt before going any further. I've always salted meat before grilling. But SV is a completely different ballgame. Salting before SV doesn't add much flavor for you on short cooks and hurts badly on longer ones (cures the meat). There are online arguments about this, but I prefer salting only after SV and preferably after searing. Taste tests support this post-SV salting approach - check out <http://www.cookingissues.com/2011/10/12/to-salt-or-not-to-salt-%E2%80%93that%E2%80%99s-the-searing-question/> for a great take on the subject.


If you keep the searing time appropriately short you won't have to rest the meat before serving. The meat is still incredibly juicy and doesn't need time to reabsorb fluids.


As for what to do with a sauce, I'd go for the butter instead and incorporate a steak-friendly sauce into a side dish. 


A quality hunk of well-marbled dry-aged beef should sing with this preparation and I'd put it center-stage to sing solo, with the side dish's sauce grooving nearby ready to join in on the chorus.

4,How can I get my Starbucks coffee to taste like the Starbucks store?,"I use Starbucks coffee they sell in bags. I have used both whole beans and ground. I've bought bags from the grocery, bags from the actual Starbucks store. I've tried many different brewers. But it never tastes quite the same. Does anyone know how to emulate their brewing technique?


",<equipment><coffee><restaurant-mimicry>,2015-01-05 20:53:00.040,52313,5,"I cannot tell you how they do it at that specific location, how your method differs, or what you're doing wrong. I don't really even know exactly how you're brewing your coffee. However, I can tell you how to brew a consistent cup using the best possible practices.


Here's a list of things to consider


* Grind your coffee immediately(not the night before) before brewing
	+ Use a Burr Grinder, not a blade grinder. This will ensure that the grounds are of a consistent size, and provides even extraction. There is no reputable coffee shop that uses a blade grinder, and with good reason. Get a Burr grinder. If you don't want to drop the cash you can get a hand mill for about ~$20-30.
* Weight your beans, do not measure them by Volume.
	+ Beans from different regions and varieties vary in density, and size. This can really throw off volume measurements.
* Use filtered water.
	+ Most coffee shops will have a filtration system for the entire store to prevent mineral build up in their coffee and espresso machines, as well as providing a better cup of coffee.
* Learn how coffee hits your palate, and learn how to adjust your brewing variables(grind size, water/coffee ratio, brew time, temperature).
* Ditch the auto-drip. Learn how to do a manual pourover or press pot. You'll have much more control over your brewing variables, and be able to pin point the extraction method that fits your palate best.


I deeply urge you to try coffee that isn't Starbucks. Starbucks might be a notch above grocery store coffee, but isn't at all *interesting*(to put it lightly). Try Stumptown, Blue Bottle, Intellegensia, Ruby's Colorful Coffees. You'll likely forget about Starbucks soon after trying coffee's from any of the roasters I listed.


Like I said. Starbucks isn't really interesting coffee. Its pretty bland, brewed with a standard auto-drip. If it tastes different it could be for many reasons, such as sitting in a thermos for a long period of time, or the grounds may sit too long after being ground. Typically larger auto-drip machines use a coarser grind because the hopper is larger. This can affect taste. There's too many variables to nail down how to brew *exactly* like *that* starbucks store.


In the mean time, I urge you to try more interesting bean varieties. You're really missing out.

16,What to look for in a mandoline?,"I've bought two mandolines recently and I've returned the first and will return the second. The first was a stainless steel contraption that:


* Broke my food instead of slicing it.
* Was ever so hard to clean. At first I thought this was because the blade was perpendicular to the food and so wouldn't slice it correctly. But on closer examination, it was because the food would bump against the plastic casing of the knife.


The second mandoline has a V-shaped knife. The blades are not adjustable. My issues with this apparatus are:


* The smallest blade will not cut straw potatoes.
* The next blade will cut French fries but won't cut through so I have to waste time loosening the cuts.
* On cleaning, the V-shaped knife will cut a slice of the sponge and it will stick there, and I don't want to find sponge in my next batch of cuts.


So, for my next mandoline, I'll be looking for a mandoline that's:


1. Easy to clean.
2. Has adjustable blades.
3. Made of dishwasher-proof plastic (as opposed to stainless steel?).
4. Safe.
5. Durable.
6. Economical in a sense that you don't end up with leftover cuts.
7. Extractable blades so they can be sharpened.
8. Size, I just got the Benriner and I should have bought the super. Three sizes, small = too small, [medium (super](http://www.benriner.co.jp/benriner_en/index.html)) is good I hope.
9. ...

",<baking><yeast><baking-powder>,2013-02-28 17:06:26.353,32295,28,"The existing answers already explain why yeast and baking powder won't work together. But even if they did, you wouldn't have a reason to use them. 


You seem to think that fluffiness depends on the amount of gas produced by the leaveners. In fact, it depends on both the gas and the ability of the dough to trap that gas. If you produce too much gas (no matter whether through yeast or through baking powder), then the fluffiness will be less than when using the optimal amount of leavener. This happens because your dough cannot hold the gas and the bubbles break, resulting in the dough deflating like a punctured tire. So even if combining two leaveners would have resulted in more ""blowing big"" action (which it doesn't, see the other answers), you would not end up with a fluffier end product. If you want fluffy muffins, you have to use a recipe and a technique which is best capable of retaining the gas produced by the baking powder. The amount of gas production is not a bottleneck.

Alternatively you can make a roux with flour in a separate pan and add it in later.

A lighter roux will add a paler color and a milder flavor, a darker roux adds a deeper color and richer flavor.

Veal's 'specialness' is in its tenderness, which is irrelevant in a sausage. You would be better served to use an mature beef chuck from an angus or longhorn.

Is it okay to refrigerate Cod (and other kinds of fish) once cooked and eat the next day?

",<food-safety><fish><refrigerator><reheating><cod>,2012-05-22 07:33:25.397,23916,1,"Yes, it's fine to refrigerate cooked fish. Many types of fish are excellent (better, even) served cold -- shrimp and salmon are good examples. If you can eat it cold, it's hard to see how reheating would pose any additional risk.


There are some other considerations, though. It's easy to overcook fish, which leaves it dry and less than tender, and that goes double if you're reheating. Use low heat (or low power in a microwave) and be careful not to cook too long. Some sauce will help keep the fish reheat, but avoid storing the fish in a strongly acidic sauce (like lemon juice) as acid will change the fish over time even in the fridge. And avoid reheating fishy things in the microwave at work if you value your relationship with your coworkers -- the smell often lingers.

I would like to use it to cook soup, potatoes, carrots, spaghetti, etc. Mainly for 1-2 people.


",<pan><pot>,2012-11-06 14:22:31.017,28266,2,"I am not sure if you want a pot (sides at least 10 cm high) or a pan (like a frying pan or saute pan.) I'll answer for pan since that's what you said. For a pot, it's less critical assuming it holds all the food. You can put a shallow amount of water in a big pot or a deep amount of water in a smaller pot, which may then boil over. You might as well get the bigger one if you're only getting one, unless it's bigger than the stove ring you intend to put it on.


On the matter of a pan, it's impossible to give a specific answer without knowing how many people you are cooking for. A pan that's right for a one-pot meal for 6 people is far too big for say frying one egg in butter - you'll need to use way more butter and you'll have some burning in the parts of the pan that don't have any egg on them.


The disadvantage of a too-small pan is that fried food will steam instead of frying due to crowding, or that what you're cooking will spill over the edges making much more mess in your kitchen. The disadvantage of a too-large pan is that it's heavy, takes up a lot of room, and possibly scorches and burns in the empty spots, or reduces too fast if it's ful of liquid, again with possibly scorching.


I like to have one pan that **just** holds two eggs, for frying one or two eggs, and one that's about the size of a dinner plate, for everything else (omelettes for two, sauteed veg for 4, the filling for shepherds pie that feeds 8, poaching fish, etc.) I also have one super large pan that I keep in the pantry and haul out for things like frying 6 hamburger patties at once. But I could get by without that one.


If you're cooking for one and can only get one pan at the moment, don't get it larger than a dinner plate. Then pay attention to whether it is more often too big or too small, and keep that in mind when the time comes to buy a second one.

Pretty sure that the temperature at the bottom of your soup would begin to climb above the shut-off level before the point where absolutely all water was removed from the rest of the pot. Judging from what happens on the stovetop when you burn your soup, it heats unevenly, and the bottom scorches while there is still plenty of liquid on top.

1/4 cup EV olive oil

With the AP flour after about 10 minutes of kneading it gets nice and smooth. But with the bread flour it was tough, rough, and just wouldn't get into a nice consistency. I added water little by little to try to get it right, but it still never became smooth.

You may find that the linked article has a lot of good information about different types of flours.


From what I've read, because bread flour is a strong flour, it requires less kneading that AP flour. And a personal observation, regardless of what I am making - biscuits, a loaf of bread, a pizza dough - when I need to add more liquid later in the process rather that at the beginning, it somehow affects the results.


I would say that if you're happy with the results using AP flour, keep using AP flour. If you want to experiment using bread flour, add extra liquid at the beginning and knead less, making sure to rest the dough before forming the crust for baking.


You may also want to try other recipes. The pizza dough (for a thin crust) I make doesn't use any sugar and a very small amount of oil. And I've read that traditional Neapolitan crust uses only flour, water, yeast, and salt.

Thanks 


",<salt><fish><brining>,2012-05-21 21:26:17.653,25455,1,"There are a number of factors that will contribute to how well the salt penetrates the interior of the piece of fish including thickness of the fish, types of tissue that have to be penetrated, and length of brine. The skin creates a significant barrier to salt penetration and the solution will penetrate the meat from its face and from its leaner side. After brining there will be more salt near the lean face than near the skin area. In order to get the most even salt penetration remove the skin, cut the pieces thin like sushi or ceviche, and brine in a 15% salt solution for 2-3 hours. For even penetration you need even contact on both sides of the meat so you either need to suspend the pieces in the solution, or flip them at regular intervals.


The surface will always be saltier than the core, but with thinner pieces and sufficient time the difference will be negligible. 


If you want to use larger pieces you will need to extend the time. Consider combining a soaking brine with injections of the brine solution into the meat itself.


You could brine any kind of fish that you would find in a sushi restaurant, just make sure it is as fresh as possible.


EDIT:


After reading [citizens](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/11479/citizen) comment I was able to find [this site](http://www.dlc.fi/~marianna/gourmet/herring.htm) which states that salted herring typically has a salt concentration of 7-13%, however [this article's abstract](http://www.springerlink.com/content/629agk7wh33rgkct/) leads me to believe that a dry cure then brine combination may be responsible for the higher salt concentration. According an [article](http://www.wedlinydomowe.com/sausage-making/curing/methods) about hams and sausages, wet curing methods can reach salt concentrations up to 26%, but maximum weight gain is reached with a salt concentration around 5%. The first site also notes that salt concentrations above 7% are considered unpalatable by most people.

12,What are some techniques to cool down a dish so that we can store it in the refrigerator safely?,"My wife just cooked some 'plof' (an Ashkenazi Jewish recipe). A one pot chicken, rice, onion, carrots dish. All those are in their respective layers.


She just finished cooking it. We're going to go to sleep. She has set her timer to wake up in a few hours to put the whole pot into the fridge.


Is this gradual cooling safe? Especially for a meat dish? Does it matter whether it has meat in it or not?


I don't want to put this hot pot into the fridge because it will raise the temperature of my refrigerator.


",<food-safety><temperature>,2013-07-22 06:39:35.960,35481,16,"There are several things in general that you can do to increase the speed at which food cools down, but two of the most effective are:


* Increase the surface area. Spread it in a wide, shallow pan, like a sheet pan, rather than a deep pot. This will allow more cooling.
* Use an ice water bath. Place the container with the food into an ice water bath, being careful not to spill the water into the food. Using a zip style bag to hold the food before putting it into the bath also can help.


A variation of this, especially for hot stocks or stews, is to freeze water in clean water bottles or zip bags, and place those *into* the food in addition to the ice bath.


For a pilaf, the first method should work very well.


You can also bring physics to the party:


* Convection is far more powerful at heat transfer than conduction. A fan for air cooling will help, or running water for water for water cooling will also help, but these are not always practical in kitchen.

5,Does resting stew lead to more succulent meat?,"My wife makes a very delicious chicken curry. Part of the ""recipe"" is let it rest for 2 hours or so until it reaches room temperature. She claims the meat relaxes and reabsorbs gravy from the curry, making the chicken more tender and succulent. She claims if it is served immediately or chilled in the fridge, it never gets this opportunity. 


I've heard of resting steaks or roasts. The idea is getting the moisture that's *already* inside the meat to stay there. But will resting a stew in fact help make the meat pieces more tender?


",<stews>,2018-07-31 18:52:40.660,91373,6,"It has nothing to do with meat absorbing liquids, that doesn't happen just as you explained it. Once meat has become dry, it doesn't get succulent again by somehow spongeing up liquid.

(What an amazing thing for this guy to do!)


Anyway, I'm using a [Weber RapidFire chimney starter](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000WEOQV8), and both times I've used it so far, it's completely filled the entire backyard with wood and paper smoke.


![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PIfbS.jpg)


My upstairs neighbors sleep with their windows cracked when it's warmer (which is when I'll be BBQing), and so I'd really like to not smoke them out of their own bedrooms at 6 in the morning. Any advice for minimizing smoke when using a chimney starter?


There's some advice [here](http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RNALG2MM6OBZ/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WEOQV8&nodeID=&tag=&linkCode=) about using only one sheet of newspaper doused with a bit of oil, but I don't know if that mitigates smoke.


",<barbecue><charcoal>,2012-04-24 11:59:03.283,23288,6,"First off, I'd cease using paper as your tinder. While it is the cheapest way to get your charcoal started, it does create a lot of smoke and ash flying around. And avoid oil-soaked paper. This will create even more smoke (I speak from experience).


I started using firestarter cubes, as they burn hotter and longer, meaning my coals are ready for cooking faster. Also, another side effect has been that the only smoke I see is from the charcoal itself. I started using the Weber ones, but they are expensive and don't burn as long. So I switched to a different fire lighter. You'll have to forgive me, as the name escapes me -- once I get home I'll edit this answer with a picture of the bag. Anyway, they're cheap, at about US$ 5-6 for a bag of 72. And they burn long, hot, and smoke-free.


The only remaining problem you'll have is that when charcoal begins igniting from a low starting temperature, it puts out quite a bit of smoke. If you are still worried about smoking your neighbors out, you will probably want to experiment with different brands and types. Stubbs briquettes are a bit less smoky on ignition, as is most lump charcoal. If you use lump, though, you should make sure you pack the charcoal ring in your WSM nice and tight, or it will burn very hot and fast. Also, put a piece of expanded steel on the charcoal grate to keep the small pieces of charcoal from falling through.

4,Why does industrially produced tagliatelle come in nests?,"I can buy industrially produced tagliatelle only in nests¹.
**Why is it delivered in this form?**


Some considerations I made myself or found in [a dissatisfying Reddit on the subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/45jvi1/eli5why_do_they_ship_tagliatelle_as_birds_nests) are:


* It might be somehow possible to exploit or preserve this form during preparation, yet I failed to do this.
* A package of nest tagliatelle has more than six times the volume than a package of the same amount of spaghetti, so I doubt that it’s logistically advantageous.
* Self-made pasta may be easier to produce this way, as [it is easier to dry them](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/50256/39335), but I doubt that this translates to industrial scales. Also, if it did, why not deliver spaghetti in nests?
* The price is the same as for other pasta of comparable quality, thus I doubt it’s a marketing gag.
* It may help measuring the pasta, but then people are not *that* stupid.


¹ Currently this is the only pasta available at all, because it’s not very famous with hoarders, but that’s another story.


",<pasta><packaging>,2020-03-22 11:23:49.390,105986,2,"To prevent it from adhering together in undercooked bundles when boiling.


For long pasta noodles, the wider the noodle, the more issues one has with them sticking together on the ""flat"" sides. Pasta that sticks together doesn't cook all the way through (because it's thicker), and at a certain stage of cooking becomes impractical to separate. Even linguine is annoying this way, and if you ever tried to cook fettucine that's sold as straight noodles, you'll find that you need to stand over the pot with a pasta fork to separate the strands.


When wide, flat noodles are sold as a nest or an uneven bundle (wide rice noodles are sold this way) they go into the pot already separated, and adherence between strands is minimal.

6,Doubling a batch of soup,"Straying from the printed recipe still makes me a little twitchy, so I ask you, gentle cooks (chefs?):


Can I safely double the cooking time? (In this case, it's a split pea soup, dried split peas - used 2 lbs instead of 1, and doubled everything else)


On a side note, the pot I picked is somewhat undersized for a double batch, as it turns out. The broth is nearly to the lip of the pot. Other than making sure it doesn't boil over during the simmer phase, is this a bad thing?


",<cooking-time><soup>,2011-02-02 15:10:50.373,11759,12,"Kara, you shouldn't need to adjust the cooking time at all. If the recipe says to bring to a simmer and then cook for 45 minutes, it will probably take longer to come to a simmer, but once it is there, you can leave it for 45 minutes.


The best recipes (in my opinion) will give you a time as a guideline, but the real instruction will be some target like ""until 160 degrees"" or ""until peas begin to break down"". If your recipe has that, you can look for those cues at roughly the same time the recipe suggests.


**edit**: I forgot to mention the pot size issue. It shouldn't be a problem. The two issues you *could* encounter would be:


* boiling over
* temperature variation


The former you're aware of already; the latter issue is that the soup at the top of the pot could be a bit colder than lower down. The two solutions are:


* use a lid (this keeps the heat in)
* stir periodically (this keeps both the heat and the peas better distributed)

20,Can/should I use baking soda when cooking beans?,"My recipe for hummus says to cook the garbanzo beans with a little baking soda to soften them. Does this work with other legumes? 


I've often seen the advice against salting the cooking water for beans, as it supposedly toughens them. Will a different sodium compound, bicarbonate, have the opposite effect? 


Would love to know the science of this issue. 


",<baking><baking-soda><legumes>,2014-11-01 19:24:54.607,49689,5,"Chick Peas (aka Garbanzo or Gram) are slightly different to other **dried pulses**, but the cooking is affected by whether they are to be cooked straight or whether they were soaked (from an hour or two to overnight) first.


In the UK a variety of dried peas known as [marrowfat peas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marrowfat_peas) are sold with a tablet containing bicarbonate of soda (baking soda) to add to the soaking water to ""soften"" it. They are then cooked to destruction as [mushy peas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushy_peas). That is the cooking method of that dish which requires that outcome -- a sort of green soup with lumps in it! But cooking with baking/bicarbonate of soda destroys the thiamin and also makes them too soft for what is usually needed.


The various **dried** lentil, pea and bean varieties are all going to need different cooking times no matter how they are cooked, but the traditional the way each was treated and cooked represents the smallest energy consumption or fuel cost to time ratio.


In the example of chick peas, soaking in fresh water for an hour or two will usually be sufficient to reduce cooking time by up to 50%. Kidney beans will need an overnight soak and are the only example of a bean I have personally encountered which will never become tender enough to eat if soaking is omitted. (True story, but then I stopped trying after they had been on the stove all day and most of a night!)


The addition of bicarbonate of soda in **fresh green beans** (also other ""greens"" such as cabbage and sprouts) was specifically to enhance the colour, or rather to stop the beans turning a grey colour -- usually only a problem if they are being cooked too long. If so much was added to taste of soap, then obviously far too much was added and the beans cooked far too long. If ever using soda for greens, always use a tiny pinch added when the water has returned to the boil. Discard all the water and drain well to serve or add to another dish.


Cooking habits have changed over recent years, as have our tastes. It would no longer be appropriate to serve fresh beans or cabbage which have been boiled hard for half an hour. Which is why some older recipes need editing and ""taking with a pinch of salt"" (if you will excuse the pun). Salt I will not even mention because of the Seasoned Advice nutrition police who cut any reference to health and nutrition from posts.


For **general rules on cooking pulses**, I strongly recommend downloading/reading the [Guide to Cooking Beans, Chickpeas, Lentils and Peas](http://www.pulsecanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Cooking-With-Pulses.pdf) a pdf file from the *Pulse Canada* website.

",<texture><emulsion><dip>,2013-01-15 23:26:49.743,30205,5,"I would suggest making this on the stove top, or in the microwave, instead of in the oven. What is happening is that the oil from the cheese separates from the rest of the dish.


If you are using bottled salad dressing and cream cheese, there is already many thickeners/stabilizers in those. (Xanthan Gum, Guar Gum, Carob/Locust Bean gum)


I suggest that you slowly melt the cheese, along with the cream cheese & salad dressing on **low heat**. An immersion blender would help to make sure the lumps are gone, after adding the hot sauce, but before you add the chicken (as long as you want to have the chicken texture).


From my experience, the oily separation with the cheese is caused by it over cooking. If you aren't a cheese snob (I am), you could substitute Velveta cheese for the cheddar/jack cheese. Do you remember their commercials with the oily gooey messes with cheddar vs Velveta? It is the same principle at work here.

5,How to scale chicken recipe that requires cooking in a single layer?,"There's one adapted recipe I like a lot, but I've been struggling with how to make it scale better so I can double the recipe to make more leftovers/feed more people. The basic technique is to cook chicken breast tenders uncovered over medium/medium-high heat in oil and balsamic vinegar (and dry spices), adding some apricot preserves about halfway through. So in the end you end up reducing the sauce into an balsamic apricot glaze/sauce, and the chicken having marinated the whole time in the sauce imparting flavor on the chicken compared to making the sauce in a saucepan and adding after the chicken is cooked. 


But in order for the chicken to cook evenly and well, the chicken needs to be laid out in a single layer in the pan, which is a bit of a limiting factor in how much chicken I can fit in the largest pan we own. Short of just making it in multiple batches, are there ways I could modify the preparation technique to come up with fairly similar tasting chicken, but in a way that I could scale the quantities larger? Would baking the chicken in the marinade achieve a similar result? Cook the sauce first, and pour over the raw chicken that's not in a single layer in a pan with the lid on? Something else?


",<chicken-breast><recipe-scaling>,2013-06-04 22:54:04.163,34519,4,"I'd try it once in the oven, and see how it comes out, and adjust from there.


A few considerations : 


* the oven itself is a closed system; this means that liquids aren't going to evaporate as quickly, and the sauce won't reduce the same.
* ovens cook from all directions, so the chicken will cook from the top without requiring turning. (sometimes good, but might throw off your cooking time in this case.)


If it were me, I'd likely try a pan in the lowest rack of the oven, with a sheet tray or sheet of heavy aluminium foil on a rack above it to help shield from radiant heat. You might also need to crack the oven door slightly. If the recipe calls for browning the chicken before adding the glaze, I might do that in the pan first, or use the oven broiler, depending on how large of a batch we're talking about.

",<cleaning><wok>,2017-12-13 05:11:14.137,86327,1,"Depending on the construction material of your wok, you can try going through the following four steps:

3) use a chain link scrubber if the salt paste doesn't work

16,Why are quiches baked in fluted tins?,"Is there any particular reason why quiches are usually baked in a fluted tin, rather than in a regular straight-sided cake tin?


",<quiche>,2020-06-18 12:39:38.507,109140,49,"**TL;DR** Quiche pans are fluted because quiche crusts are ruffled.


Quiche crusts are ruffled for the same geometric reason as muffin liners and some coffee filters are ruffled. Try fitting an inelastic disc into a cylinder, covering the bottom and sides, and the disc builds ruffles on its sides. Since the ruffles of the crust are somewhat fragile, they are best supported within flutes.




---


This is one of the cases (much rarer than most people think) where it has an objective advantage, as opposed to randomly developed tradition.


Quiches are made with a crust of shortbread or flaky savory pie dough. This dough is not very friendly in handling. It tends to crumble rather than stretch, sticks everywhere to the point of smearing, and has low tolerances with respect to temperature, mechanical stress, and others.


Imagine you have just rolled out your crust - which is hopefully all in one piece, evenly thick, not stuck to your counter or to your rolling pin, not so cold as to crumble from stiffness and not so warm as to smear or lose its flakiness, and circular (as opposed to a map of the Scandinavian peninsula complete with fjords). Getting all these at once is already an achievement which requires quite a bit of skill and/or luck. Now you manage to lift your crust from the counter and place it in the pan.


The crust is now lying such that its center coincides with the center of the pan. The edges are draped over the sides of the pan, so there is a gap between the crust and the pan. You now start fitting the crust into the pan by lifting the edge in one point, and gently stroking the radius pointing to that point from the center to the pan wall, such that the crust lays flush on the bottom of the pan. At that place where the crust meets the pan sides, both the crust and the pan have the same radius.


Now your crust is a bent disc. Let's say your pan is 3 cm deep and has straight, non-fluted sides. Then, if you have the crust follow the side in one point, the radius of the crust at the upper edge of the pan is 3 cm larger than the radius at the same point in the bottom of the pan. Choose a next point 1 cm further the circumference of the pan and also press the crust there. The arc of the pan between the two points will have a 1 cm span - but as the crust has a larger radius, its arc at that place is longer! Basically, when you try to bend the crust to go up the sides of the pan, it ruffles. And you have no elasticity to work with to somehow make the crust get together on top or stretch on the bottom - if you try, it tears or crumbles. You also can't just fit the ruffles beside each other - you can try, but their shape will suffer a lot during baking, if they don't break apart under pie weights during prebaking. If they survive, they will be underbaked because of their thickness.


When you have a fluted pan, the troughs of the fluting take in the ruffles of the crust. You now have a single-thickness crust everywhere without stretching, tearing, or whatever. It bakes properly and doesn't have any problems with geometry. Also, it looks pretty.


Given all of the above, I am pretty sure it was a major factor in the design becoming popular.




---


For those who have trouble imagining it visually, I found [a video which shows the process pretty well](https://youtu.be/pQj_Kv9DKew?t=190). Interestingly, this baker strengthens the crust by folding it double and then smushing it into the flutes, something I have never tried.

1,Why does the temperature of resting turkey increase for a while?,"I have seen many references to the temperature of turkey increasing for a while when resting. This would seem to contradict the first law of thermodynamics. 


",<roasting>,2019-04-21 05:19:22.530,97607,4,"Not at all. 


If we measure the temperature of a “lump of meat” that’s to be roasted, we place the tip of the probe at the center or the thickest part of the roast. Oven temperature is usually way hotter than the temperature we are trying to reach at the core, which means the outside will be nice and crisp (see Maillard reaction). 


Meat is a relatively bad conductor of heat, so you get a quite steep temperature gradient, or plainly said, the outside starts browning while the center is still cool. Part of the art of roasting meat is to achieve the balance between juicy and cooked interior and browned, but not burnt exterior.


But back to your question: When you pull your turkey from the oven, it will have the aforementioned temperature gradient. As we all know, this will tend to even out and for the coldest spot (where the probe is), it means getting warmer (while the outer areas get cooler, just as stipulated in the first law of thermodynamics). For a cook, it also means to factor in this so-called “carry-over cooking” and pull the bird slightly before the desired core temperature is reached. Note that in cooking and baking, temperatures of dishes are typically given for the coldest spot.

5,Does an induction stove require flat bottomed vessels?,"Does an induction stove require flat bottomed vessels? What materials besides stainless steel works for an induction stove?


",<stove><stainless-steel><electric-stoves><induction>,2013-12-09 17:23:38.593,40380,5,"Most reputable [sources](http://www.sga.com.au/secure/downloadfile.asp?fileid=1032301) say that curved surfaces such as woks don't work as well on induction stoves. They even make special tools and cooktops for inductively heating woks. This phenomenum could be because of the angled surface or the extra distance from the cooktop, but it's probably both. It's not that these surfaces are immune to induction heating, just that they aren't efficient.


Angled surfaces won't respond as well to induction stoves since the maximum amount of energy is generated in a surface when it's flat with respect to the stove. (Magnetic induction is proportional to the cosine of the angle between loops, for those of you who want to know the physics).


Distance is probably the biggest factor. Induction works at a small distance from the stove (there are numerous examples on the web of induction heaters working through newspapers or a magazine.) However, the design of these cooktops makes it so the magnetic field that drives the heating dies off over a very short distance (For example, the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health determined when studying their effect on pacemakers that the field is negligible after 10 cm or 4 in).


As far as what materials work, usually cookware that's induction cooktop compatible has a curly icon on the box to indicate this. Common compatible materials include magnetic stainless steels (not austenitic steels), iron, and carbon steel. The article on induction cooking on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_cooking#Cookware) has a great explanation on what cookware works for induction cooking and why.


There common rule of thumb is that if a magnet sticks to the bottom of a pot or pan, it's compatible with an induction stove. Surface resistance is a more scientific measure, but to get the complete picture of why certain things do or don't work would require a college course in material electromagnetics. For a more detailed analysis, see the wikipedia page I linked. For most cookware these are only minor concerns compared to the magnet test, until you accidentally leave aluminum foil on an induction stove and it starts to melt.


It should be noted that cookware needs *some* inductive metal in it, but not all of it needs to be an inductive metal. Some cookware designed for an inductive stove has an iron bottom with aluminum sides because aluminum conducts the heat better for more even cooking. Clad cookware with a mixture of the right metals works too.

",<temperature><color>,2018-07-06 06:07:25.127,90833,30,"The ""browning"" or ""coloring"" of food during cooking and baking1 is a reaction of temperature and/or time. As a rule of thumb, the hotter your pan or oven, the faster the food will brown.


There are two chemical reactions (or rather chains of reactions) that play a significant role in cooking:


* The [Maillard reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction), which affects proteins (-> browning a steak)and
* [Caramelization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caramelization), which affects the carbohydrates, i.e. sugars (-> baking a cake).


Both require temperatures well over 100°C (212°F), so one of the easiest preventative measures is to add water to the food you are cooking, which should keep the food at 100°C (212°F) until all water is evaporated - for example blanching or steaming vegetables instead of stir-frying them or poaching a piece of fish or chicken breast vs. pan-frying or grilling. For ""dry"" preparations, just don’t heat up your pan too much - often 25% or so of the maximum power will suffice- and simply stop cooking before you see browning. You may have to finish cooking it by a low-temperature method, if it's not done at that point. 


In your sample recipe, this happens when you add the cream and simmer the asparagus for another ten minutes or until soft.

In general, to reduce the bitterness in citrus juices, peel the fruit first before adding it to the juicer. As in the lemonade example, I sometimes use the lemon peels to make [Limoncello](http://bit.ly/hHYTqf), or keep a few in the fridge to garnish my coffee. If you have no use for them, they will at least make your garbage smell very good.




---


**Maintenance** 


You need to clean the juicer after each use, which can be discouraging. If you have someone who lives with you, have them help. My husband peels and juices the lemons, I wash the juicer parts while he mixes the lemonade in the pitcher. It takes us about 15 minutes from start to finish.




---


**Experiment**


You can throw anything in the juicer as long as you remove large pits and cut it to a size that fits the opening. It will fit a whole lemon but you need to halve an apple. 
The juicer - at least the model I have - also comes with a recipe book. Not that I ever used it. I just use whatever I have left over and try to make something tasty.

3,What is the name of the sauce served with fried rice in Indian restaurants,"I have noticed a lighter sauce like liquid (watery) with green chilies cut in it served along with fried rice in Indian restaurants. It tastes slightly like soya, and has visible round pieces of cut green chilies in it. (It's definitely not mint chutney.)

3,Why does the beef in Goulash need to be floured and brown before cooking?,"In most recipes [example from BBC](http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/180653/beef-goulash), in making a Goulash, a step is to brown/fry lightly the beef in flour before the stewing steps. Why is this done? 


Since the beef will be in a liquid it can't be to prevent drying. Is it to keep the form and texture of the beef?


If you fry without the flour what difference is made?


",<beef>,2013-09-30 14:14:00.983,37238,7,"Flouring the beef does two things:


* It facilitates the development of a crust on the outside of the meat that is brown and flavorful;
* It contributes to the development of the sauce, as the starch will dissolve off of the meat into the sauce, where it will swell at about 180 F, helping to thicken the sauce.


In this particular recipe, the flour is the only source of thickening, so it is being used for both purposes, but mostly for the second, where it is essentially creating a *roux* as your brown the beef, because you are also cooking the flour in the olive oil. In this recipe, omitting it would give you a much thinner sauce.

6,Chicken curry in a slow cooker turns out watery,"My first question on here, so please go easy on me. 


I have recently got a slow cooker and have been very pleased with the results, but that was using ready-made sachets of cooking mixes. 


I am now trying to cook things properly from scratch but I think I'm missing something important. 


This is the recipe I have used for chicken curry:- 


* 4 chicken thighs
* 3 garlic cloves
* 2 large onions
* 1 green pepper
* 1 red pepper
* handful chopped spinach
* 100g mushrooms
* 400g tin chopped tomatoes
* 250ml chicken stock
* 3 heaped tsp of curry spice


I put everything in the slow cooker, give it a good stir, and then leave it to cook. It tastes nice, but the sauce is very watery. 


I have used the same recipe in a pan and the sauce thickens after I simmer it for about 20 mins. 


Do I need to change the recipe to use the slow cooker? Or am I doing something fundamentally wrong? 


",<slow-cooking>,2015-01-29 20:53:42.420,54169,11,"A slow cooker needs a lot less water for the same recipe than something you simmer in a pan for 20 minutes. The sauce thickens in the pan because a lot of the water evaporates.


In this case, most your water is in the chicken stock. To get all of the flavor, but less moisture, drastically reduce, or even eliminate the stock. You've got plenty of water without it. Use a tsp of chicken base to keep the flavor without the water (recommended: [Better Than Bouillon](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0087VVOB8)).


That alone will probably solve your problem. If it doesn't, come back to this question and edit it to tell us what you tried and any problems that remain, or ask a new question if the problem is different.

5,How to get crispy vegetables chips/fries without frying?,"Specifically for sweet potatoes, I'd like to get crispy fries via the oven rather than a fryer. Here are some pointers I've read in other recipes:


* Cuts must be as equal as possible to ensure even cooking
* Wash off excess starch / let raw fries sit in a bowl of cold water to remove excess starch


Also, I just purchased a mandolin so I'd like to hear any techniques/advice on getting crispy vegetable chips. 


Thanks in advance for the help.

Unfortunately, my results have been disappointing and inconsistent. With the thinnest setting on my mandolin, I sliced up some sweet potatoes and beets. I've tried some of the tips mention on the [Chowhound](http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/378235). I've tried a variety of heat settings but I haven't found the sweet spot of heat and time just yet. With those two variables I really don't want to perform 10-30 trial runs but it's looking like I need to if I want to determine the best configuration. I'm going to try some other tips and report back.

Though I've never had great success with crispiness, my overall best results were with a temp of 425.


Crispiness with sweet potatoes is notoriously difficult due to the high water and sugar content (which will caramelize and make them appear and to some extent taste burnt, usually long before they crisp up). There's some discussion of this on [Chowhound](http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/378235). 


Key points seem to be:


* remove as much surface moisture as possible prior to cooking
* avoid overcrowding the pans, especially when cooking thicker cuts
* use a convection oven if possible

23,What exactly is apple cider?,"What exactly is apple cider?


I've been using Apple Bandit Cider for some recipes in which I needed to reduce the cider. However the Apple Bandit Cider is like a low-alcohol fresh cider/beer kind of drink. And I recently heard that this is an incorrect literal translation of the apple cider. Apparently there is a difference in what we call apple cider in the EU vs. the US.


So when using apple cider, is it best to just use an unfiltered sort of apple juice, or what is the closest description of the actual good?


",<substitutions>,2019-09-05 09:07:59.753,101170,28,"What is apple cider?
--------------------


In earlier times, it just meant ""apple juice"". Nobody had different words for the non-alcoholic and the alcoholic variety, because the freshly pressed (and sometimes cooked) juice fermented on its own when stored unrefrigerated.


In the days of refrigeration, there are different products made by pressing of apples, and stabilized to keep their properties when refrigerated. It just so happens that linguistically, the name ""cider"" has stuck for a non-fermented variant in the US and for a fermented variant outside. Besides, there are companies who have been using modern technology to approximate the fermented version without following the exact process, this is how products like the Apple bandit come into being. (There are also companies who approximate the non-alcoholic variety, but I think they market it simply as apple juice).


So the word has no single ""exact"" meaning. All three types are a cider.


Which one is better to use?
---------------------------


The answer may sound disappointing, but it is best to use the type meant by the recipe author. Ideally, the author would have known of the linguistic problem, and specified what they mean. Since the ideal case rarely happens in reality, you have to take your best guess based on what you know of the recipe source. That is, if it is an American recipe, use unfiltered apple juice, if it is European, use the alcoholic kind. Also, especially for older recipes, or ones which require much manipulation (such as your reducing step), it is preferable to use traditional-process cider. The modern style cider like Apple bandit is fine-tuned to taste good when drunk straight from the bottle, but it might behave very different from old time cider when heated.


In the end, if you have no idea where the recipe came from or who the author is, you can just start with whichever type is easiest for you to use, and see if you like the result. If yes, stay with it. If not, try with a different type.

42,Pasta: is simmering equivalent to roiling boil?,"I recently got into a surprisingly heated argument with a friend about what level of boil you should cook your pasta at. He (an engineer) argued that the heat transfer would remain the same regardless of the level of the boil and that anything above a simmer would be a waste of energy. I looked at it less from a heat transfer point of view and argued that a higher boil would increase agitation and cause the noodles to stick less to each other.


So what is it? Is a higher boil actually a waste of (a minuscule amount of) energy?


",<pasta><boiling>,2010-08-01 19:25:14.700,3951,21,"You should boil noodles. Simmering is *not* the same as boiling. Boiling water is 212 ℉ (100 ℃). Simmering water is in the range of 185 ℉ to 200 ℉ (85 ℃ to 93 ℃). 


Your engineer friend is under the mistaken assumption that simmering is somehow a weaker boil than a rolling boil, but still 212 ℉. It's not.


You are correct in your assumption that the more vigorous rolling boil will agitate pasta and help prevent sticking.

3,Is risotto or paella rice a better substitute for my Japanese dish?,"My supermarket has stopped stocking Japanese ingredients, just as I decided to make a Katsu Curry for my dinner party tonight!


I have Paella rice and Risotto rice (Arborio) - both by Sainsbury's and I know that they should both be ok substitutes as they are traditionally short grain white rice (although the box of arborio lists it as medium), but I want to know which is better. 


I am planning to cook according to [this BBC](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/japanese-rice-gohan) recipe.


**Which rice is my better bet and are there any considerations/changes to the recipe?**


",<substitutions><rice><curry><japanese-cuisine>,2020-02-10 15:46:06.233,105255,0,"As it looks like this won't get an answer (presumably because they are as good as one another/no one has tried side by side) I thought I'd update with what I did.


I used the Paella rice because it had a shorter grain and Japanese rice also has a very short grain.


All the recipes I found online (I browsed about 5/6 of the top results) said to rinse until the water is clear so (sorry GdD) but I ignored the advice above for the most part. I needed to wash about 8 times before I gave up - the water wasn't completely clear but it was better than it had been.


I then soaked the rice for a couple of hours (because I had time) but most recipes agree that you should for at least 30 minutes. I then **drained** and added cold water at a ratio of 1:1.7. 


I put the rice on the stove with a lid on and brought it to the boil. 


I boiled for 10 minutes and removed from the heat and let it sit for another 15 minutes. It's apparently important that you don't remove the lid.


I added a tbsp of mirin per 300g of rice and 'fluffed-up' the rice with a plastic rice spoon.


The rice was definitely sticky and there is no way I would have wanted it more so (in fact it was probably slightly too sticky) so I am very glad I washed the rice and will probably try rinsing a couple more times in the future.

2,Do Dumplings Mind Being in the Fridge?,"I made dumplings from white flour and Atora vegetable suet. The suet is in hard pellets so I'm not worried about having overworked the mixture. I made them at the same time as the stew to save on wash-up. Then I stored them in the fridge for 4 hours before putting them in the pot for 20ish minutes. The pot was in the oven at 140C. They quickly puffed up and filled the top layer of the pot. But when cut open they had a different texture inside and (presumably) the taste of raw suet and flour. Is it likely the fridge or sitting time can explain the failure?


**Edit:** I still have some spares in the fridge and the pellets of suet are still visible in them. So I definitely did not overwork the dough.


",<slow-cooking><refrigerator><fats><stews><dumplings>,2016-12-12 09:50:11.107,76383,3,"It's not putting them in the fridge that is the problem, it is the fact they were cold when you put them in the stew. The effects of this would be:


* Longer cooking time: the 20 minute time assumes that the dumplings are at room temperature, if they are cold they will take longer to cook as their internal temperature is lower. 20 minutes is a guideline anyway, you should test their doneness after 20 minutes even when starting from room temperature
* Closer texture: cold dough into hot liquid is going to result in a closer texture because the outside is going to cook long before the inside gets warm enough to expand


The way to fix this is to take the dumplings out of the fridge and let them come up to room temperature before cooking, probably 30 minutes or so should do.

16,My olive oil didn't solidify in the fridge. Is it fake?,"After reading about scandals involving adulterated (and sometimes fake) olive oil, I decided to test a bottle of Bertolli olive oil. Bertolli in particular has been sued for selling fake olive oil, and successfully fended off the case by claiming their suppliers defrauded them.


The bottle had about an ounce left in it. I placed it in the fridge for about 11 hours, and it's still liquid. From my understanding, olive oil should solidify in the fridge. Is this conclusive proof that the oil was not real olive oil?


",<olive-oil>,2012-06-26 00:35:15.010,24692,19,"How liquid was it when you say liquid? Our kitchen is very cold in winter and may very well get to fridge temperature at night time and the olive oil gets white balls of solidified oil in it, and then goes very sludgy, making it difficult to pour, if not impossible. But it doesn't exactly solidify. So it depends on whether you mean it is completely liquid like normal or not. 


This website implies that most oils should be unpourable by 35F (1.7C), which is the lowest temperature for a fridge (i.e. any particular fridge or part of a fridge may be slightly warmer than this):
<http://www.oliveoilsource.com/page/freezing-olive-oil>  

(This same information is found on a multitude of sites, so I do not believe this is the original source)


However, it also says that olive oils may be ""winterized"" which means they do not clump or cloud, even at 32F/0C. This is so they can be used in salad dressings, etc, that are stored in the fridge. So you would need to find out if your olive oil had been so treated. I am not sure if this process is just used for oil sold for commercial use or not.

The tutorial suggest that garlic has to be fermented for 40 days continuously to become black garlic. It would be difficult to leave my oven, slow cooker, or a rice cooker unused for other cooking for a month.

My first attempt in my rice cooker had uncovered garlic heads in it for 10 continuous days-- the result was black but dried hard as rocks (and the process stank up the entire house the whole time).


My second attempt involved wrapping each head in two layers of foil, then putting the garlic in a much lower temperature warming oven (no thermostat at all, just a light bulb) for 10 days, which resulted in beige garlic. I then switched it over to the rice cooker for 2 days, turned it off, checked them, then another 2 days, turned it off, forgot about it for a day, checked them... another 2 days, turned it off, checked them... and found DELICIOUSNESS.


It needs more time, I think, it's not as sweet as I'd like yet and could be a little darker. I've seen some Koreans mention finishing the batch by just hanging the garlic in a bag for a week, so that's what I'm going to do.

0,Does freezing sap freshness? Will acids bring the flavor back?,"I just dethawed a frozen lentil soup which was poorly seasoned before it went into the freezer.

Once I thawed it, I corrected the seasoning and observed there was this unpleasant metallic flavor to the soup. I can't put a point on it, but it tasted ""off"". 


I considered for a moment: what if extreme temperatures sap the freshness out of food by reducing the acidity of the fresh product? Lo, when I gave it a slight splash of sherry vinegar, all was right again. However, I love sherry vinegar and use it often in any salad or soup to sour it up to my taste.


My question is: does freezing reduce acidity in products? Is acidity what we perceive to be the ""fresh"" flavor of things not previously frozen or boiled to oblivion?


",<freezing>,2014-04-02 21:13:38.170,43230,2,"Freezing will not reduce acid. Chemical reactions tend to slow down when at freezer temperatures, not speed up.


Fresh flavor is a complex amalgam of many factors: texture, aromatics, color, and so forth. While acid is perceived as lending a brightness, it is not the only factor in freshness. After all, your sherry vinegar is far from fresh, but quite acidic.


While there may have been something off in your stored portion that was masked by adding additional vinegar, it is almost certainly not related to having frozen a portion of the soup.

---


In case you're wondering, what we were eating had a sweet batter, but not overly; had blueberries in the batter; had no icing or frosting; was perhaps about three fluid ounces (1 dL) big; and had been baked with a paper wrapper.


",<language><muffins><cupcakes>,2013-09-09 06:51:03.853,36632,79,"There is considerable overlap between cupcakes and muffins.


### Method


From a technical point of view, muffins are made by the *muffin method*, making them small quickbreads. In the muffin method, the wet ingredients are combined in one bowl; and the dry ingredients are combined in another bowl. Then the two are quickly incorporated together with minimal mixing to avoid gluten development. This gives muffins a somewhat coarse crumb.


Cupcakes are small cakes, and are made by one of the traditional cake methods such as the creaming method, the reverse creaming method, the genoise method, the chiffon method, and so on. They tend to have a finer crumb than muffins.


### Contrast


While no single criterion distinguishes a muffin from a cupcake if you do not adopt the technical definition above, the following trends exist:


* Cupcakes tend to be sweeter than muffins; there are savory muffins such as cornbread
* Cupcakes are often iced or frosted, whereas muffins tend to have no topping, or a simple crumb topping
* Cupcakes usually have a head or top no larger than the body of the cupcake; muffins are often encouraged to overflow their baking cup, so that their top is larger in diameter, giving them somewhat of a mushroom shape
* Cupcakes are almost always, well, cupcake shaped; muffins can be made as just muffin tops
* Cupcakes are almost never crispy or crunchy; muffins are often encouraged to brown and develop texture, especially on the tops

Apparently, it is the very same gene that can either make a tomato uniform or tasty, depending on whether it is ""switched on"" or not.


It sounds promising, if the industry picks up the study's suggestions. But not that I, the consumer, have this information, is there anything I can do to get a better product? Do I just look for uglier tomatoes?

Also, just ""ugly"" isn't a sufficient description. What you're looking for is irregularities in color, shape and size. Bruising, blemishes, wormholes and brown streaks don't indicate a better-tasting tomato, just one which has been abused.

Much denser, and smoother in consistency (I'm unsure if this is what is meant by ""fudge like"" or not). The molten part of the restaurant cake also seems thicker.

Even if I use a large amount of oil, it still disappears, presumably into the vegetables. This leads both to the vegetables getting too oily, and for the need to use more oil once I start sauteing a new vegetable.

If you add vegetables to cold oil in a cold pan and then heat everything up, your veggies (or just about anything else) will soak up the oil. Heat the oil in the pan until it starts to shimmer and a drop of water sizzles, dances and disappears. THEN add your veggies. The very definition of ""saute"" comes from ""to jump and to dance"". It's all about the hot oil. Be wary of your oil's smoke point, don't let it burn, but get it good and hot.

If you're trying to brown slices of eggplant, the way she treats shrimp is very similar to how you want to handle eggplant slices.

1,Can dried peppers get hotter with aging?,"I have some dried hot peppers which are over a year old. These are hybrids, part chile de arbol, but less hot so that I can use them for mixed company. A friend grew them for me specifically because of their medium hotness.


After around 16 months in doubled ziplock bags, I used some of these in a couple recipes last week, including a Mexican squash casserole. The dried peppers were partly rehydrated prior to use. 


While I remember being able to use 2 or even 3 of these peppers in a recipe when I first got them, even one of them made the dish so hot I had to quickly make something else for two of our guests. This happened three times over the last couple months, so it's not just which individual pepper I pulled out. It seems like these peppers got hotter with ageing, something I'd think was impossible ... shouldn't they lose capsaicin as they age?


So, my question is:


1. Is it possible for a dried chili pepper to become hotter with ageing, instead of losing flavor?
2. If so, what causes this?


I'm guessing that it's just my faulty memory, but I'd love some verification. Thanks!


",<chili-peppers>,2012-05-06 18:33:11.840,61870,3,"I'm going to say **yes**. In 2013 we grew 6 varieties of mild to hot peppers. On the mild side was Poblano, and on the other was an extremely hot habanero variety. As these peppers matured we would pick them, slice them, dry them on a dehydrator then deep freeze them. 


At the end of the season we had around 2.5 gallons of dried, frozen peppers. They were not stored by type but all mixed together. That Christmas we ground down the 6 pepper mix into a powder, filled several spice jars and sent them to family along with our raw honey and homemade soap. This mix packed a serious punch. I use it on just about everything and we got nothing but rave reviews from those we sent it to, all folks that love spicy food. 


Now in 2015, I finally used the last of the spice so I dove into the coffin freezer, pushed aside the 2014 and 2015 harvests and pulled out the last gallon of 2013 peppers. Since they had been frozen for two years I put them on a dehydrator for 24 hours then ground them up just like I had before. I'm telling you these peppers are so much hotter than the first batch it's not even funny. This coming from a guy that can drink Siracha. If you can so much as see the small red dots on your food then you put too much on. The difference between the same peppers ground up in 2013 vs 2015 is incredible.

2,What should I know about the peels of raw fruit and vegetables?,"I've not been paying much attention to what I ate, but now I have just become a vegetarian and want to try eating much more raw foods. 


I know that in many fruit and vegetables, most of the important nutrients are found in the peel or directly below it; however, it is also commonly known that for example the green of tomatoes contains a poison and must be removed before consumption. 


I'd like to know what other fruit and vegetables contain potentially bad substances when eaten whole and raw (or put in a blender etc.), and what to look out for.


Also, many people remove the skin of mushrooms before eating them; is this actually advisable?


",<vegetables><fruit><mushrooms><vegan><raw>,2011-10-20 09:25:23.347,18713,2,"In my experience, whether or not you peel a fruit or vegetable has more to do with how easy it is to digest than any level of toxins. If you're going into the realm of herbs, however, then you need to be more careful, as some are quite potent. But as long as we're sticking to fruits and veggies, here's my advice, and it's pretty simple:


Clearly things like melons, and corn don't have edible peels, simply because their outer layer is too difficult for us to masticate, and then digest... Things like citrus peels can be digested, but not when they're raw. They need to be pickled, cooked (think of marmalade) or turned into a zest. When it comes to soft, thin peels, like apples, pears and kiwi, it's more of a personal preference. Some don't like the feel of a furry kiwi slice going down, but I don't mind it, so I slice it right into my cereal. 


In the realm of veggies... Yes, stems are great for you. If it's really difficult to chew it, it's not going to be broken down enough for your stomach to handle it, and extract anything useful from it. Ex: Broccoli stems - they'll benefit even from some light steaming, and they're GREAT for you. But raw? Rather difficult. The florets however are a classic raw snack. That's my general guideline. Same with artichokes. They need some kind of cooking in order to be digested. But carrots? Kale? Celery? Simple chewing pulls them apart enough to make the extraction of nutrients easy for the body. 


Hope that helps!


Mindy


P.S. A great tip for raw kale - not everyone likes the consistency of raw kale because you have to chew it for soooo long. BUT, if you massage it with a bit of lemon juice, and a touch of olive oil until it softens, and the color brightens (5 minutes or less), it's easier to chew, very tasty, and you haven't cooked any of the nutrients out of it!

-1,What is the best way to denature proteins in chicken soup using an acidic ingredient?,"From my understanding, if you add lemon juice or apple cider vinegar to chicken soup, the acidic ingredients will denature the proteins. 


1. If I want the protein in the soup to be denatured using these ingredients, what is the best way to go about it and get manximum denaturation and depth of penetration? Eg. should I marinade it, should I simply slow cook it with ingredients added at start, or should I brine in a cider/lemon solution? Please post the recipe I need.

For any substantial effect, the acidity has to be pretty high. Adding a little acid to a soup won't do it. You need to add enough to bring the pH fairly low; your soup will be as sour as lemon juice. You probably don't want this, so instead marinate.


When you put meat in marinade, only the outside of the meat is exposed to the marinade. So penetration starts from the outside. It slowly moves inward, but of course marinading time is limited, even in the fridge you can't go too long to prevent spoilage (and freezing will stop the marinade from penetrating). You can add enzymes (papain, also known as ""meat tenderizer"") to help. But it still has to get through from outside in.


To get full penetration, you want little distance from edge to middle as possible—that is, as little ""inside"" as possible. You could:


* cut raw chicken into small chunks
* cut raw chicken into thin slices
* run raw chicken through a meat grinder, or buy ground chicken
* run raw chicken through a food processor, etc.

8,Are gas stoves preferred in a commercial kitchen due to having a constant heat source,"I'm a home cook and have never been inside a commercial kitchen - I believe though, in a commercial kitchen, gas stoves are preferable due to having a constant heat in contrast to an induction or halogen hob which 'pulses'. 


I live off the gas grid (meaning I have no gas), and I was wondering, other than gas, does any other type of cooking ""technology"" (that is suitable for an indoor kitchen) offer constant heat or anything that can heat to as high a temperature as gas can?


",<stove><heat>,2020-05-16 08:48:59.940,108428,13,"Commercial burners generally have a high power output. A commercial kitchen doesn't have to be large to have 12 burners, all capable of 3kW, in a small space, plus ovens, and running near constantly. By this point the cost saving of gas over electricity becomes significant (in the UK, electricity is about 3x more per kWh). In addition many premises wouldn't have sufficient electricity supply to support that in addition to all their other consumption, and running a fatter cable is very costly. 


Only induction gets the pan up to cooking temperature as fast as gas, and although it's getting cheaper, it's still expensive to install. I've seen induction wok stations used for food that's cooked to order; one advantage is that they need less extraction than gas (but still some).


The pulsing you mention isn't really an issue. The fairly thick aluminium pans used in many commercial kitchens, and the large thermal mass of food being cooked would tend to minimise fluctuations in the temperature of the actual dish


Many of these reasons don't apply at home, but many of us prefer gas anyway for its controllability (at least compared to mostelectric stoves, I've only cooked on induction a few times and fairly simple stuff).

41,Why is there cow cheese but no pig cheese?,"I have always wondered what there is no cheese made from other milks other than cow, goat or sheep. Are they not suitable for humans? Do they taste bad? Is it even possible to make dairy products with them?


",<cheese-making>,2011-05-03 22:16:33.333,14507,43,"There are several main reasons, historically:


1. Cows, sheep and goats have udders, and can be milked by hand into a bucket. Pigs (or cats, or humans for that matter) have nipples, where you need to suck the milk out. Consider that most of the cheese in the world was invented before machinery was able to create a vacuum, this means that the only option would have been to suck milk from the pig and spit it into the bucket.
2. For making cheese, the fat/protein ratio in the milk is important. It changes, obviously, from species to species, which is why there aren't many hard yellow cheeses made of goat's milk.


Lastly, I have actually had camel's milk ice-cream, which goes to show that it's just a cultural thing mostly.

37,What is the purpose of creaming butter with sugar in cookie recipes?,"I got distracted while assembling the dry ingredients for a cookie recipe and added the sugars, which were supposed to be creamed with the butter first. Fortunately, the sugar was added last and I was able to salvage enough to cream it.


What does creaming the butter and sugar actually do? Had it been on the bottom of the bowl under the flour etc, could I have just beat everything together?


The recipe is simple and just calls for creaming and then adding egg, and after that, dry ingredients. It's nothing fancy.


",<baking><sugar><butter><cookies>,2010-07-25 00:24:35.980,3144,34,"Creaming puts the air bubbles into the mixture. The baking powder only helps enlarge the bubbles, not make them.

To [cream the butter keep it cool and do it for a few minutes](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/17/dining/17bake.html) (at 65°F, harder in the summer).


It has [recently been discovered](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf990435+) that cookie dough is different from cake batters. Sugar is part of the structure of the cookie and not just a sweetener, tenderizer, and browning agent. It forms the base upon which the fats and the starch granules of the flour are embedded. The sugar needs to dissolve for the matrix to form.


If you beat the whole thing, it will be harder to get bubbles in and you may end up overworking the dough. The cookies will end up flat and tough.

",<cheesecake>,2010-07-26 10:20:07.450,3296,15,"New-York style cheesecake **shouldn't** have much rise to it. The mixture is basically a custard and the only rise would come from steam created in bubbles that are incorporated during the beating process. 


While a REALLY smooth texture is the goal, you don't want to aerate the batter as in other cakes or you'll end up with cracking on the surface from the expansion of the air bubbles. Pull the cream cheese out a couple hours in advance to ensure that it is at room temperature throughout. Eggs must also be at room temperature and can easily be warmed by putting the whole egg in a bowl of hot water from the tap for 5-10 minutes. Having these ingredients at room temperature will create a really smooth texture without beating in too much air. 


In regard to sweetness, you might be able to increase the sugar slightly (compare the ratio of sugar to cream cheese in your recipe vs. others), but be careful not to add too much. Excessive sugar will make the custard too watery from the formation of sugar syrup and will make it difficult for it to set up.

1,Why does broiled and roasted salmon give these different results?,"I ordered roasted and broiled(grilled) salmon form the restuarant and noticed both products tasted quite different. I don't have a great digestive system but noticed that the roasted salmon agreed with me more than the broiled salmon. I want to understand what was it about the specific cooking methods that gave the different end products.


Broiled slamon
The sides were crispy and quite browned. The fish didn't have the natural flavour of salmon/seemed to have lost it. The oil tasted greasy and mechanical if that makes any sense.


Roasted Salmon
It was not browned or crispy like the broiled. It tasted like normal salmon i.e. similar to poached salmon. Oily was present but not greasy/mechanical tasting like the broiled salmon.


Basically the roasted tasted closer to poached salmon. However I read that roasted salmon is to be done at 450f and this would brown it just like grilled. 


My guess is that they roasted the salmon was done at a low tempertare and for a short time hence the slamon retained its juices, didn't get too processed. The broiled salmon was probably done very high and also the smoke may have gone in the meat or something to that effect. I want to understand what happened. 


1. I have no idea what happened but based on the cooking methods can you explain why the broild and roasted salmon gave the different results?
2. If it was due to low temperature and short time as I am guessing, wouldn't I then be able to grill at a low temperature and for a short time and create the same result as with the roasted salmon? Or would the fact that I am broiling still cause other chemical differences in the meat even at low temp and low duration broiling?


",<roasting><salmon><broiling>,2016-10-29 00:17:33.413,75095,3,"Roasting doesn't really imply a specific temperature. The roasted salmon you've had *might've* been done at 450F, or perhaps a lower temperature. Either way, it doesn't require tons of browning. You don't want to overcook salmon, so you'll cook it until it's cooked through, and even at 450F, that doesn't necessarily mean a ton of browning. If it's on a bare metal pan with plenty of room for juices to get out and evaporate, it'll brown more; if it's in a crowded pan that has water in it most of the roasting time, it might brown a bit on top and none on the bottom.


Broiling, however, basically always means high temperatures. The air temperature might be 500-550F, but there's radiant heat too, and the food is close to the heat source, so it can brown easily and rapidly. On top of that, the main heat is coming from the top, so by the time it cooks through, it can easily brown on the top. Getting things crispy and browned is one of the main points of broiling.


So no, I would not expect roasting to have as much browning as broiling would. If your goal is not to brown too much, then just don't use a broiler - bake/roast at some ""normal"" oven temperature.


(As for ""greasy and mechanical"", I don't know - you could've been tasting burned oil, or maybe there was some other variable besides the broiling.)

1,Dehydration temperatures for long-term preservation,"I am dehydrating fruits and vegetables with a home dehydrator. I found in the internet varying recommendations about dehydration temperatures, ranging from 45 to 65 C (113 to 150 F). However, since dehydration is used also for short-term consumption (by raw-food enthusiasts), I am not sure the recommendations are good for long-term preservation.


So, my questions are:


* If I dehydrate in 45 C (113 F), for about 24 hours, and keep the dehydrated stuff in tightly closed glass jars - can I expect them to be preserved for about 2 years?
* If the answer is no - what is the minimal temperature that I should use in order to guarantee preservation for 2 years?


",<food-preservation><dehydrating>,2014-05-20 18:06:54.190,44276,2,"The temperature varies not by how long you want to keep the item, but by what you are dehydrating. Consider a carrot. A raw carrot will keep for literally months. A cooked one at room temperature will not even keep for days. So, when you're dehydrating carrots (for example to reduce the weight of the food you take camping) you want to be sure not to cook them in the process. Now, consider raw meat such as jerky. This has a LOT of water in it. If you dry it at too low a temperature, it will spoil before you have reduced the water content enough. Same for a fruit puree. But herbs, if you have it too hot you will draw out the flavours and just keep dehydrated dust.


My dehydrator came with a book telling me what temperatures to use for what products. There are also words on the temperature dial. This is a cropped shot of my model on the [manufacturer's website](http://www.excaliburdehydrator.com/dehydrators/4-tray/4-tray-starter-excalibur-2400):

While you can't read the words, they say ""fruit"", ""vegetables"" etc. The coolest temps are for herbs, then it goes raising bread, making yogurt, then dehydrating veg, then fruit, and finally jerky. 


And just as you can't choose one temperature to use for dehydrating any and all food, nor can you assume one keeping time for any and all food. My book also tells me which things keep for months, and which for years. I don't think there's anything that will let your dried meat keep for years, but you should do ok with legumes and some vegetables.

Gelatine Sieve :


When cream is first made from milk, the cream needs to be strained from the milk. To do this, a very high-quality strainer with fine pores are needed to separate the two liquids of different densities. The better the sieve used, the better the quality of the skimmed (low/non-fat) milk produced.

Commercial cream production consists of 5 main steps (from [here](https://www.fitsa-group.com/en/connaitre-creme-industrielle/), lots of info about different types of cream there too):


1. Skimming, centrifugation: separation of fat globules in milk. Milk skimming is done in a centrifugal cream separator.
2. Fat standardisation: in order to obtain the expected fat content.
3. Homogenisation: to prevent the creaming phenomenon during storage and to allow an increase in cream viscosity (for low-fat fluid creams)
4. Heat treatment: the objective is to inactivate microbial lipases and as a result destroy pathogenic germs without damaging the cream organoleptic qualities. Most creams are pasteurised.
5. Seeding and maturation: pasteurised creams may be matured with acidifying, aromatic or even thickening mesophilic lactic bacteria. Maturation gives more taste to the creams and protects it against lactic acid and bacteriocin production.


Gelatin would make a poor filter for this sort of thing - it is weak structurally and diffusion of the water molecules through the pores is slow - it would take days to [dialyze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis_(biochemistry))/strain the volumes produced in a commercial system, which increases the risk of bacterial and fungal contaminants growing, and makes the system slow.


Gelatin is added to some creams (thickened cream (UK/AUS/NZ), whipping cream (USA)), to act as a thickener and produce a smooth stabilized foam when whipped. Gelatin can come from a variety of animal sources, but generally pigs and cattle which is why creams need to be certified as halal. Many commercial products contain vegetable derived thickeners (e.g. carrageenan) instead of gelatin

Granted, ""salsa"" is spanish for ""sauce"" but in American cooking a sauce and a salsa are generally regarded as different things.

So, if we were to quantify what exactly a sauce, gravy, salsa, chutney, etc. are what are the differences?


",<sauce><gravy><salsa><chutney>,2013-06-23 18:04:56.477,34884,6,"In their various parts of the world, all of these words mean sauce, at least some of the time.


They come from different cultures, though, and carry different connotations at least in US usage. Short answer, though: there are no absolute differences that you can count on.


### Salsa


This is a generic term in Spanish, and in South American cuisines. It can cover everything from a thick, dark mole, an adobo, a light and piquant salsa verde, or the typical tomato, onion and pepper sauce often served with chips in the US.


Some salsas are smooth; others are chunky. They can be cooked or raw.


Many people use the word to indicate the red, fresh or lightly cooked tomato salsa with onions, garlic, peppers and usually cilantro often served in Mexican restaurants in the US, but this is only the beginning of what salsas can be.


### Sauce


The generic term. Almost any flavorful liquid put on another food to enhance it. These range from elegently smooth (such as hollandaise) to quite chunky such as putanesca sauce.


### Gravy


Gravy tends to be a sauce made from meat drippings, and thickened to serve with the meat or its accompaniments.


In Italian-American usage, it often covers ""Sunday Gravy"" or a ragu made from tomatoes and one or more (or many meats) that in some communities was traditionally made on Sunday; and more generally, any sauce with meat in it.


I am told that in Italian in the context of pasta sauces, the actual word is (forgive my spelling) accompanimento, an accent for the pasta which is the star.


### Chutney


The word chutney derives from the India/Pakistan region, where again there are a myriad different sauces that carry the title.


In the US, it tends to be used for a chunky, acidic sauce made from fruit and/or vegetables. This overlaps considerably with jam or preserves, in this sense, although chutneys tend to be much more strongly spiced, and may contain complex combinations of complimentary ingredients.


Still, this doesn't cover the full range such as a chutney of pureed cilantro and/or mint, which is much more thin and sauce-like than the above more typical US usage.


### Conclusion


You cannot really draw strict distinctions among these categories. You have to know what the specific sauce or item is that is being discussed to strongly draw inferences about it.

9,"What is the shelf life of a garlic bulb, with the ""skin"" still on, left in the fridge?","I purchased a head of garlic and I have 2/3's of it left over, I am storing it in the fridge in a ceramic covered dish (made specifically for garlic :) a gift from my mother) and I would like to know how long I can continue to expect fresh flavor from it. What would the garlic look like if it had indeed spoiled?


",<storage-method><storage-lifetime><garlic>,2012-06-06 17:31:47.503,24254,17,"Garlic will spoil faster in the fridge actually. I don't know how long it will last in the fridge, but I understand that it lasts longer if you leave it in a cool, dark, dry storage. I believe one reason is that your fridge is generally too humid. In my experience, garlic kept in the fridge is also more likely to develop mould (goes soft, and dark discolouration).


I keep mine in a ceramic thing in one of my cupboards. It lasts anywhere from a few weeks to a few months depending on the garlic (probably how long it sat before getting to my kitchen). If you store it like that, garlic that goes ""bad"" will usually start to sprout (green shoots, will come through the top.

40,How to clean mushrooms?,"Some people say cleaning with water removes the taste from mushrooms. 


But if I don't use water the mushrooms will carry a lot of dust.


Do you have any techniques for cleaning mushroom so I don't eat crap but don't spoil the mushroom?


",<mushrooms>,2010-07-09 20:37:59.193,89445,9,"It's important to note that wash or no wash, mushrooms themselves already have a high water content so their ability to absorb more water is limited. Estimates I've found put the range between 75-90% water, depending on the type of mushroom. *Cooks Illustrated*, for example, puts it at 80%. 


Sources such as *Cooks Illustrated*, Alton Brown, Harold McGee, Robert Wolke, and Kenji Lopez Alt have tested washing mushrooms by weighing them pre- and post-wash, and all found that mushrooms absorb a minimal amount of water that does not significantly affect cooking time. Both McGee and Wolke soaked the mushroom for five minutes - so much longer and with more direct contact than than a normal simple rinsing. Lopez Alt's testing, for example, found that the mushrooms absorbed only about 2% of their total weight which translated to an extra 15 to 30 seconds of cooking time. After testing, these sources all encourage washing mushrooms. 


Several of the sources also observed that most of the additional weight is on the surface of the mushroom, which can either be patted dry with a towel or paper towel, or removed with a salad spinner, as other previous answers here have noted. 


*Cooks Illustrated* suggests only washing whole mushrooms, as when cut they can become more absorbent. They also suggest that if you are serving the mushrooms raw, use a tooth brush to brush them clean rather than rinsing because rising can cause discoloration. 


Washing should be only done just before cooking. Washing and then storing mushrooms can shorten their shelf life and they can become slimy on the surface. 


Wolke notes that if your mushrooms are steaming rather than browning, it's more likely that your pan is too crowded rather than a function of having washed them. 


*Cooks Illustrated* describes their process [here](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/features/8349-mushrooms-101-everything-you-need-to-know), McGee in *The Curious Cook*, Wolke in *What Einstein Told His Cook*, Lopez Alt in *The Food Lab* (and also [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/02/how-to-clean-and-chop-mushrooms.html)) and the best I could find for Alton Brown were transcripts from the [Good Eats Fan Page](http://www.goodeatsfanpage.com/season2/mushroom/mushroomtranscript.htm). Both the the *Cooks Illustrated* and Serious Eats links also have more general tips on mushroom storage and prep.

3,Espresso machine has to warm up halfway through pulling a shot,"I've had my espresso machine for a little less than a year. It's a DeLonghi EC155. It heats up fine (I assume so - a green light that means ""ready"" turns on, and I've followed the instructions and let it sit for 30 minutes heating before using it), but when I pull a shot, it makes the sound of the water being pushed through the grounds, but the green light turns off halfway through the process. I stop pulling the shot, wait for the light to come on, and finish pulling the shot.


Usually when I dispose of the grounds, they're very watery. Is there a way to make the machine hold heat longer, or is it a defect with the machine?


EDIT: It should also be noted that the light turning off halfway through is a relatively new occurrence. Before about a month ago the ""ready"" light would stay on until after I had pulled my shot.

Let it finish.


I assume, if it is working like my machine, that the water is being re-heated for a next shot.


1st thing I would do is to clean the machine with a ""descaler""; it should help with the water heating system and the pressure.


If that does not help, have the machine looked at.

7,How can I create a varied (or at least tasty) menu for a 12 day hike whilst using as few ingredients as possible?,"I'm going on a 12 day hike with my boyfriend in a couple of months. We'll be at a mountain station that has limited supplies (e.g. meat) for sale every couple of days, but ideally I want to carry as much food as possible (buying food in the wilderness is expensive!). We'll be walking 15-20 kilometres a day. We'll be cooking food on a small gas burner (can only cook one thing at a time).


I've never hiked for more than 3 days before and I'm at a loss on how to plan to feed the both of us for that length of time. Whatever I bring needs to be low on weight/space taken up, and yet be high in energy and nutritional content. And preferably so that I can use the same ingredients for different meals. I don't want to bring something that I'm only going to use once.


I hope this is on topic here, because I would really need advice on what to eat, how to plan a menu/eating plan, how to make the food taste good with limited resources/time. 


",<menu-planning>,2011-05-21 14:20:01.147,14965,2,"We take home-dehydrated cooked meat (beef, chicken, ground beef) along with spices, tomato leather to make tomato sauce, pasta, rice, dehyrated potato-and-sauce (eg scalloped potatoes) from the grocery store, home-dehydrated vegtables, and dried fruit.

You might also be interested in making your own english muffins since bread products squish and don't keep well: <http://www.gregcons.com/canoe/muffins.htm>. 


Backpacking is tougher than canoeing but as long as you can be sure of plenty of water, you should be fine with dried products. We usually bring a little frozen meat for the first night, and frozen bacon for the first morning, well wrapped in newspaper, but those might be too heavy when hiking.

4,Toasting bread in a gas oven,"I am trying to toast bread in a gas oven on a rack about 8 inches from bottom, but all the toast in the centre part of the rack are burnt and the ones to the sides are perfect, is this a normal thing with gas ovens or is my oven faulty? The bottom cover is in place I have not adjusted anything, I use a temperature setting of 180 degrees Celsius. Please do not chastise me for trying this I am just experimenting to see if I can Economize on equipment and even energy as most of the times something else will be going in the oven.


I suspect that it is because of where the flame is at the bottom and that I could place a thick metal plate on the centre of the oven floor, to prevent this, but I prefer to hear from someone with experience or any other expert.


",<bread><oven>,2010-11-19 14:59:14.980,9268,3,"We do that frequently. Hot spots develop in our oven too, but we control the thing by just swapping the bread from center to edges twice along the process.

9,Milk temperature for white sauce,"Should I introduce the milk hot or cold when making white (béchamel) sauce?




---


Searching around I found multiple opposite opnions, like on [this answer](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/4392/20814) (see the comments).


Also different advice from famous chefs:


* [*""heat the milk in a separate pan until just about to boil""*](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/mario-batali/bechamel-sauce-recipe) - Mario Batali
* [*""a great tip is to make sure your milk is really cold, this will stop your sauce from going lumpy""*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlMtbX-0ABA) - Gordon Ramsay
* [*""if you have a hot rue, you have cold liquid; if you have a hot liquid, you have a cold rue""*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MblXGeJjb6s) - Marco Pierre


",<sauce><temperature><milk><bechamel>,2013-10-19 15:00:49.947,37744,7,"As you see from the variety of advise from reputable sources, many combinations of hot/cold roux and liquid will work.


From a convenience point of view, you want at least one of them hot in order to speed the integration. If you started both of them cold, it would probably *work* but take a while to warm up to melt the butter in the roux, and free the flour particles to integrate and create the sauce@mdash;and it will won't fully thicken until the mixture is at a boil, so this is inefficient. You would probably also have to mash and stir more frequently to prevent local burning.


If you start with both hot, it will also work, although you might have to whisk relatively quickly—but who has both a hot base and a hot roux sitting around? Usually, at least one was prepared in advance, even if only by a few minutes. Batali is recommending this method, but note that in the professional kitchen, where he lives, time is the most constrained resource, so this is his method of choice. His line cooks probably have hot roux ready at all times.


A hot roux is easier to scoop and measure.


A hot liquid will quickly melt and dissolve the roux.


But in any case, if the roux is properly made, the starch granules are surrounded by fat, and so are not going to cause lumping in any case, despite Ramsay's advise. As soon as the mixture is warm enough to melt the butter, the particles are going to move away from one another, and won't be able to clump together before they are hydrated.


So I would not worry about this in the slightest.

15,Do induction cookers increase risk of cracking cast iron?,"I recently purchased a counter-top, one element 1800W induction cooker, mostly just to see how well the technology worked compared to my gas range.


I took it out of the box and immediately threw about a half inch of water in a cast-iron skillet as a test and set the coil to max power. I noticed that the water began boiling almost immediately (impressive) but in very tight hot spots (two very clear concentric rings, presumably the shape of the coils or some magical physics property of the magnetic fields), taking a long time to spread to other areas (as expected with cast iron).


In fact, the hot spots heated up so quickly that the water was almost completely boiled before the handle had even a hint of warmth, and areas as close as a half inch or so to the hot spots remained cool to the touch for some time after the hot spots were hot enough to boil water. 


My question is: Due to the rapid heating and large temperature differentials seen here, in practice does this lead to an increased incidence of cracking cast-iron with induction cookers? If so, what precautions should be taken (e.g. preheat cast-iron at a lower power first, only use cookware designed specifically for induction, etc.)?


",<cast-iron><induction>,2015-03-13 00:18:08.773,55652,12,"Cracking? No, not in my experience. I own like 20 cast iron skillets (I've been told I have a problem).


Warping? Yes. I have a 2,800 watt per burner commercial induction stove with a very small pattern like yours. If you repeatedly overheat a pan on high for searing, it will eventually bow outwards. Warping can be mitigated by preheating your pan gently.


That said, if the pan is full of water or oil (for deep frying, not stir fry) there is nothing to fear. I have had the same stainless stock pot for 8 years and I roast it on high all the time (with liquid). Water is a very effective coolant (it's what keeps your car engine from overheating). The likelihood that a pan full of water will overheat is very unlikely, nigh impossible.

12,"Why does the fat on my chicken broth sometimes solidify, sometimes not?","I've been making chicken broth pretty much the same way for decades. I cut up a whole chicken, cutting through the bones of all but the breast and thighs (to release marrow). I pretty deeply brown the pieces (with skin) in the bottom of a stock pot, then remove. I then saute roughly chopped onion, celery and carrot in the chicken fat until browned, then I deglaze with a little wine or sherry. The chicken pieces go back in the pot with a gallon of water, I bring just to a boil, cover and turn off the heat. Now it sits for a half an hour or so. I then fish out the breasts, refrigerate the breast meat, and return the bones and the skin to the pot. I simmer the remaining pieces for about another 40 minutes, remove the thighs, reserve the thigh meat, break the bones, return the skin and bones to the pot and slow simmer everything for the better part of the rest of the day. I allow the broth to cool, strain through a colander then a fine sieve, then refrigerate overnight. 


Here's what's weird. Half the time, I can simply remove hard solid fat from the top of the chilled broth. The other half of the time the fat separates and thickens, but never solidifies, I end up dirtying my fat separator. I can't figure what could possibly be different from one batch to the next. I generally even buy the same brand of chicken and I only add a tiny bit of oil (vegetable) for the initial browning.


Even weirder, sometimes the broth is so full of gelatin that it is actually harder than the fat, it makes for a good soup when that happens, but makes separating the fat a bit of a pain.


",<chicken><fats><broth>,2013-09-20 07:17:18.630,36959,6,"It's down to what the chicken ate while it was alive. Saturated fat sets, olive oil sets if you chill it, but not otherwise, and a number of seed oils do not set (rapeseed for instance). When you make a stock which has solidified fat on top, that's saturated fat, so I'd hazard a guess that the stock where the fat doesn't set means a healthier eating chicken, because it contained less saturated fat to start with.


UPDATE: Thank you to the person who bothered to do the research and said my answer 'might have some merit'. Chickens are no different from human beings - the fats you put in are the fats floating round your bloodstream and depositing in various places; think about corn fed chickens, where the fat composition is slightly different, not to mention the colour of the flesh itself. That will be a partial explanation; when taken together with the fact that not all chickens, even in the same flock or brood, get to eat the same diet, because the pecking order dictates that some free range birds don't always get the pick of the food, explains differences in chickens from the same supplier. Of course, if you can come up with another explanation, I'd be delighted to hear it...


UPDATE 2: Perhaps I should have been clearer. I am not for a moment suggesting that the fats eaten are deposited in their original form, but if you know anything about biology (chickens or otherwise) then you'll know that certain synergies occur, depending what's put in, which change the composition of any fats deposited within the body system. Hence the connection between eating lots of saturated fat and having high cholesterol in humans, for example.


UPDATE 3: Rumtscho: Can't find any scientific evidence so far to prove this theory regarding chickens, but, for interest's sake, and to prove how much of a difference it can make, farmed salmon in Britain no longer has a balanced omega 3/6/9 ratio, as it should do, and still does in the wild. It's because the feed had to be changed, and the consequence of that has been a much higher level of omega 6 in particular. I'm still looking for something on chicken.


UPDATE 4: Now I've had time to look properly, it's not at all difficult to find scientific evidence, there's plenty of it. There's a study carried out by The American Society for Nutritional Science in 2000 comparing the fat deposition (and other metabolic processes) between chickens fed the same diet, but one lot with saturated fat included in the form of tallow, and the other lot with polyunsaturated fats. The fat deposition in the birds fed tallow was greater, and the composition of the fat contained more saturates compared to the polyunsaturated group. These results reflect previous studies (Sanz et al 1999 and 2000). 


Effectively, it's like everything else - you get back what you put in.

When it's time to make the smoothie, I would take a few of the ""kale cubes"" and blend it with, maybe orange juice or some other liquid. Does anyone have any better ideas for keeping kale fresh for a long time - and by long time, I mean around 2 weeks. Ideally, I would want a solution like the one I describe above - it's efficient and quick to make a smoothie doing it this way.

They indicate you will get about a year of storage from this method.




---


That being said, the method you propose is well known for herbs, and kale is certainly much heartier than an herb. It should work very well, given that the application is a smoothie and you don't mind having the kale pureed already. It should keep the kale usable for a year or so as well.


So the main issue with the traditional method is, are you willing to blanche your kale? I know not everyone is.


If you use kale for other dishes and have to blend your daily smoothie anyway, you might use the standard method, and store it in daily sized batches, thus giving you the ability to use it for either a smoothie or some other dish.

-1,Blood essential to making delicious Bison Meatballs?,"We got a few more bricks of bison than usual due to the Whole Foods sale - they seem to get more bloody the longer they sit in the fridge (1/14 date). 


Tried making meatballs for the very first time. I'm not a cook by any chance and the first time I try making something with food, it's often ??? - it was surprisingly delicious. 


Totally winged it off Chef John's Italian meatball recipe. Splattered Italian seasoning, allspice, oregano, olive oil, splatter of buckwheat flour. Mixed it up. Broke into ~1.5"" pieces of meat on a Safflower oil greased baking sheet. 425F preheated oven and 20 minutes later - the most delicious ever. Dash of more Italian seasoning. Add capers. Sea salt. 


I was not expecting it to come out so well - did not even need to let the meat marinate or anything. Simply mixed it up in a bowl - and with just a butter knife (couldn't find spatula). 


The baked coagulated parts (blood?) were exceedingly tasty. **No sauce was used or made.**


This really makes me wonder what made it so delicious. Was it because of the blood?

All of which you seemed to follow. I'm not sure where are you from, but I'm used to eating meat with much less than that - barbecue to me means simply meat + salt + fire and it is delicious when properly made.

32,"What does ""bring to a simmer"" mean?","First, a confession: I work in software, so I'm probably paying **way** too much attention to the state of liquid that is ""a simmer"". That written, I love to cook, and no recipe direction gives me more confusion, sadness, and googling than ""bring to a simmer"". Accept no substitute. I find this to be the most vague direction in all of culinary science, and it drives what's left of my organized mind insane.


So here's the setting. I'm making vichyssoise, because I'm intrigued by the possibility of making a dish that has no color at all. I've been instructed to ""bring to a boil and simmer the soup for 35 minutes.""


The internet is filled with unsatisfying and at times contradictory answers. My research yields a few prototypical examples:


1. [""Simmer"" means ""low or off position,""](http://answers.ask.com/Sports/Other/what_does_simmer_mean) suggesting basically no heat at all.
2. To ""simmer"" is [to heat to a temperature point just off boiling, generally acknowledged as somewhere around 95 degrees C or something like 195 degrees F.](http://www.bestrecipes.com.au/glossary/Simmer-L77.html)
3. ""Simmer"" is something like a [""soft boil,"" a vague state that appears to be between ""not bubbling"" and ""roiling""](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/15432/at-what-point-is-water-considered-at-a-boil), but which by definition must boil in some way, since you know, it's bubbling.


Each of these examples mean fundamentally different things. As far as I can tell, a ""simmer"" is a phase transition whereby the suspension in question, whatever the soup, sauce, or solid (apparently you ""simmer"" bratwurst, you never boil it) may be, cooks in a way that only years of experience or training can identify. Hence, my question: 


What does ""simmer"" mean? Does it differ per recipe or is it universally defined? 


EDIT: Did a bad copy/paste job from another window. 


",<temperature><simmer>,2011-11-27 01:25:38.777,19161,20,"Personally, I would argue that 2 and 3 are actually the same, and they are your answer.


If you heat a pan of water you'll notice the bubbles forming before the water is actually boiling, hence the talk of between not bubbling and full on roiling.


Also, when you're making your soup, it isn't pure water, so the boiling temp will not be a perfect 100 degrees C in any case.


So, I would say, that simmering is when you keep it just under a full boil. Watch what you're cooking, there should be gentle movement, but not a full roiling pan of whatever it is you're cooking.


To get something simmering away, you need to bring up to a full boil, then reduce the heat until you're getting movement, but not full bubbling.

3,Preserving dehydrated fruits and vegs,"We bought a food dehydrator to make dog treats with. Primarily we're dehydrating yams, apples and bananas. I'm not dehydrating these to crisps because I didn't think I needed to. The dehydrated yams that we buy as dog treats are still pliable and leathery, so I didn't think I needed to dehydrate them totally dry. 


The problem I'm having is that these treats are going moldy in about 4 days. Again, the treats we buy never go moldy. I'm assuming they're adding something to the commercial version to stop this.


Does anyone have some hints on what I'm doing wrong or any idea what the commercial brand is putting on them to stop this. The apples seem to be the slimiest first... Should I be drying the apples to crisps?


",<fruit><sweet-potatoes><bananas><dehydrating>,2011-09-27 13:44:53.137,18039,10,"You get mold (and less visibly, bacteria) growth after 4-5 days because your water (humidity) content left in the deyhdrated food is greater than 5%. Typically dried apples (and other types of fiberous dried fruit) have humidity levels closer to 20% when you don't dry them to a crisp. That means the treats you make aren't shelf stable, but luckily this can be fixed with some experimentation.


Each food has it's own requirements for preservation. Here are some quick guidelines to try out on apples. For yams and bananas, I would try dehydrating them a bit more closer to being crisps.


Steps:


1. Wash fruits thoroughly before dehydrating. I don't do this, but you could try using a ""fruit wash"" (product for washing fruit).
2. Dehydrating isn't sterilization - the dehydrator isn't hot enough to sterilize the food, so some of these 'nasties' are left on there and waiting for their chance to grow. Commercial-grade food is always sterilized. Because a dehydrater isn't sealed well, I suggest you nuke the treats in your oven for 5-10 minutes on high heat AFTER you dehydrate the stuff, experimenting to make sure you don't dry them out too much in the oven. Also, be careful because the sugar is concentrated in dehydrated fruit, so it will burn easily. Wrapping the fruit in tin-foil before placing it in your oven is a potential trick because this effectively sterilizes the fruit in a steam bath. If you use foil, you'll need to cook them longer - start with 15 minutes.
3. After the treats are dehydrated and sterilized, try storing them in air-tight containers and always away from light in a cool/dark place. They need 7-10 days to ""equilize"" the moisture between each dried piece of fruit. Make sure to shake the containers every once in a while so they don't all stick together.


BEYOND THIS, there are more advanced techniques that you can easily try - including conditioning the dried fruits and a number of fruit-baths that preserve the fruits with harmless chemical solutions, like Ascorbic Acid (vitamin C). Try reading more on this link from UC Davis:

1,Can putting items with high heat capacity smooth out heat changes in Sous Vide?,"So was recently thinking about the [beer cooler sous vide method](http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/04/cook-your-meat-in-a-beer-cooler-the-worlds-best-sous-vide-hack.html) and had a thought:


While heating the water to put in the beer cooler, if you were to place an object with a high heat capacity (e.g. a ceramic coffee cup) in the water, heat both to the desired temperature and then place them in the beer cooler, would that help keep the water at a more constant temperature?


In other words, since you are replacing some of the water with a material at a higher heat capacity at the same temperature that would in turn keep the rest of the water warmer for a longer period, correct?

0,Acceptance of sweet rice dishes in Japan,"My father once told me a story about some Japanese guests coming over to Europe. On their stay here they were once served a sweet rice dish. The guests were so shocked that rice would be served this way that they outright refused to eat it. In an effort to save the meal they even poured some soy sauce over it which of course completely ruined it.


Now I'm asking myself, is this the common opinion in Japan? I remember a scene from the anime ""One Piece"" - which is one of the most popular ones - where some guy is giving a girl trouble for making a sweet rice dish, thus I think it must be a rather widespread habit.


Since rice is so very important in Japanese cuisine I would have guessed that they would use all kinds of flavouring available. Is there a special reason behind this? And does this only occur in Japan or other asian countries too?

Sweet preparations are certainly common. Perhaps your father's story, and your anime example, illustrate better what might happen when people expect one thing, and are presented with another. However, I think your generalized conclusion is incorrect.

3,Use orange juice instead of water for syrup to make Orangettes?,"I used [this serious eats recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/01/orangettes-recipe-how-to-make-chocolate-orange.html) to make orangettes. After removing the oranges from the syrup in the end I further reduced it in order not to waste it. After tasting I though it could do with a bit more orange flavour and wondered: 


* Could I just squeeze the peeled oranges and use their juice instead of part or all the water in the syrup to make the leftover syrup taste stronger of orange?
* Would this affect the Orangettes? How?


I'd also be interested in suggestions as to how I can use my syrup.


",<candy><water><juice><syrup><oranges>,2016-03-23 09:27:47.887,67685,2,"Letting the peel simmer in the syrup is to candy the peels, as they are too bitter to be eaten as is.

If it makes you happy, you can replace some of the water with juice. When not wanting to waste, I just eat the oranges.


As to the syrup, I understand you do not like to waste stuff, but it is just water and some sugar (with some extra flavor now), so I usually discard it. However, if you really wanted to, you could use it in several applications, but make sure you account for the correct ratio (orange sauce for a duck breast, maybe you could add it to a cake if the water is no problem, you could make turkish delight with it, etc.)

**Can I use sprouting ginger? Just like regular/dormant ginger? Or is there something to keep in mind?**


My main focus is on the culinary aspect: While sprouted ginger isn't toxic, I'm wondering whether it requires special or different preparation, how to handle the sprouts, and do sprouting (""growing"") and mature (""dormant"") ginger taste differently in dishes.

7,How long will infused alcohol last?,"I'm attempting to infuse alcohol for the first time, and I'm wondering how long the infusions will keep? I've read a few different (contradictory) opinions on this matter. One recipe for vanilla vodka said to store in the fridge and use within 3 months. I've even seen ""use within a month"" for some infusions. Others say, ""it's alcohol, it will keep forever."" I'd imagine the alcohol would act as a preservative allowing it to keep for a very long time.


In general, is there a reason to consume infused alcohol within a specific timeframe? Taste? Flavor? Safety? Would this differ based on whether it was infused with fruit, herbs, or spices? Is there a reason that you may want to store infused alcohol in the fridge/freezer instead of leaving it out?


Would there be any special considerations for what I'm infusing right now:


* Vanilla vodka
* Jalapeño tequila
* Rosemary tequila

Probably depends on the final alcohol percentage though, like if you add enough juice that the percentage goes less than 10 or so percent, you have to have more precautions in sanitizing everything. I usually sanitize anyway because it can't hurt, and I already have the equipment to do so from homebrewing.

When frying in a pan I don't like monitoring the temperature of my oil. My food, therefore, comes out much more oily than it should. I also don't like cleaning and storing a gallon of frying oil.

5,"How can I make breadcrumbs without a full, yeast-leavened loaf of bread?","What's the best (fastest, most efficient) way to make breadcrumbs from scratch, without having any old bread?


I'm curious if there's something quick I can do, when I realize I want 5 cups of breadcrumbs and have no old bread, and don't want to buy or bake a loaf of bread just to immediately pulverize it.


That is, what is the fastest, simplest, easiest bread-like thing one could make, which would turn into breadcrumbs in a food processor?


One more edit: I didn't really intend this to be asking ""what other ready-made things can I buy (or have around) and turn into breadcrumb substitutes"". I want to know, at the very least, the best way to streamline the process of making and drying bread given the fact that I don't care if it's ever moist enough to eat as bread, and don't care about its overall shape or texture or anything else we usually care about in bread.

Yeast bread develops a particular flavor and larger hole structure than quick bread though. The flavor of a quick bread breadcrumbs should be slightly different, but in many dishes the subtle difference won't be overwhelming unless the breading is a 'star' of the dish. The hole structure really doesn't matter luckily - as developing that is a large part of the time factor of real bread.


Drying it out will be the harder part. The denser structure holds moisture better, so slice it thin and give it low, dry, long heat.


Personally, anything that you're going to *make* for the purpose of breadcrumbs that isn't just a substitute (like cereal, crackers, etc in the other answer), sounds like it'd be easier just to make a loaf of fast rise bread to me.

6,Avoiding clumps in cacio e pepe?,"I've been trying to make a very basic three-ingredient cacio e pepe over the last few days and have found it difficult to create a smooth, creamy sauce.


I'm using only two cups of microplane-grated pecorino romano cheese, a handful of spaghetti, and crushed black pepper. Salt in the pasta water, too, of course.


I've tried it two ways and gotten varying results:


1. Cooking the pasta shallow water in a wide pan to concentrate the starch. Then, drain, lower the heat and add the pasta back in with a few ladles of water and adding the cheese gradually, tossing stirring violently with a wooden spoon.
2. Add some of the pasta water to the cheese in a separate bowl a few minutes before the pasta finishes cooking. Whisk the pasta water and cheese into a paste, then add the finished pasta to it with some extra water and, again, stir like crazy.


Neither seems to work very well, though my best results so far came from (1), but I'm quite convinced it was luck. What might I be doing wrong or overcomplicating? Everything I see on the Internet says it should be ""very easy"", but the lack of videos showing this recipe has made it difficult to learn. The videos I have seen use a lot of olive oil and butter, which I'm told is *absolutely not traditional or okay*.

Here are some tips:  

(1) Make sure your cheese is grated as finely as possible, and that it is at room temperature or warmer. A microplane is perfect. 


(2) The water you add can't be too hot. Scoop some pasta water out halfway through the cooking process, allow it to cool, and use that to add later. 


(3) Drain pasta and allow to cool a minute before dressing. 


(4) Some find that combining pasta and cheese in a cool pan is better (so that you can control heating). 


(5) Some combine the water and the cheese, then add that mixture to the pasta.


(6) The addition of fat (butter, cream, oil) helps the cheese to emulsify, but this addition varies and is sometimes not included.

7,Is there cultural variations on what is consider offal?,"Is there cultural variations on what is consider offal?


My mother bemoaned to me the other day that when she was young ox tail was not considered 'real' meat and that when beef was culled on the farm where she grew up the tail was given to the labourers that helped with the slaughtering. Fast forward 40 years and now ox tail has gotten the hipster treatment and now it is pretty much the most expensive meat there is. 


So did what was considered tripe or offal change with certain cultural norms or values or has the definition stayed reasonably constant over the last century?


",<meat>,2015-05-11 17:08:26.133,57417,7,"**Short summary: views on these various body parts are never constant, whether over time or even within communities.** 


Part of the difficulty with this question is the very definition of the word *offal* and what it implies. First, a little mini-history, taken partly from the *Oxford English Dictionary*.


*Offal* is literally derived from *off* + *fall*, i.e., that which ""falls off"" or is discarded during some sort of process; the word entered English around the year 1400. This sense is rare in modern English, but it still occurs in some manufacturing processes, e.g., woodchips that are discarded from milling.


In the 1400s, it was applied in the same sense to butchers, who initially included only those things which were cut off/out of the carcass and truly considered inedible or useless from a culinary perspective (e.g., the contents of the intestines, which would contain the animal's waste and would rarely be consumed because of the potential for disease, parasites, etc.). Gradually, this definition expanded over the years to include elements that butchers might discard or separate from the primary ""meat"" (i.e., mostly muscle). As the *OED* defines it:



> 
> The edible parts collectively which are cut off in preparing the
>  carcass of an animal for food. In early use applied mainly to the
>  entrails; later extended to include the head, tail, and internal
>  organs such as the heart, liver, etc.
> 
> 
> 


Given that many of these ""discarded"" or separated items were not considered as desirable for eating, the word gradually acquired a negative connotation, which the *OED* first finds in 1581:



> 
> The parts of a slaughtered or dead animal considered unfit for human
>  consumption; decomposing flesh, carrion.
> 
> 
> 


The *OED* adds that this last sense is ""Sometimes used contemptuously,"" as in the first 1581 quotation that references ""dirtie tripes and offalls.""


In answering this question, there seems to be a conflict between two possible interpretations about the word *offal*: on the one hand, there's the ""offal"" that's discarded because it's truly *inedible* or difficult to use in a culinary sense, but then there's the ""offal"" that's merely *separated out* because some people or some cultures find it repulsive. 


That latter **""offal"" is still generally used by *somebody***, whether it's


* eaten by people who don't find it repulsive (and might even consider it a delicacy)
* eaten by poor people who can't afford more desirable food (as referenced in the question when oxtail was given to ""laborers"")
* ground up, processed, and disguised in processed foods
* given to animals to eat


For a recent perspective, I quote from the book *Offal: A Global History* (2013) by Nina Edwards:



> 
> What might the term ""offal"" include? The *Chambers Dictionary's*
>  definition sounds a little less than enthusiastic: ""waste or rejected
>  parts esp. entrails, heart, liver, kidney, tongue etc.: anything
>  worthless or unfit for use."" Other edible innards not specified here
>  include connective tissue, bone marrow, lungs, spleen, sweetbreads,
>  testicles, udders, tripe, heads and the features thereof (brains,
>  eyes, cheeks, snout or muzzle and ears), skin, tails, trotters, lard
>  and blood. Offal is sometimes thought of as inner organs and viscera
>  alone, but I include all edible exterior parts.
> 
> 
> 


Including all edible (yet undesirable by some) parts seems reasonable in the definition, given that even as early as 1660 the *OED* has a quotation lumping in sheep trotters with ""offal."" But in some places the word carries a distinct connotation of ""organ meat"" specifically.


In any case, as said at the beginning, the perspectives on these various body parts are never constant, whether over time or even within communities. Most cultures have entire classes of animals that are considered inedible or repulsive, whether pork in Jewish or Islamic traditions or almost all insects in various Western cultures. The concept of ""offal"" is just an extension of communal dietary guidelines or preferences to the avoidance of specific parts of animals.


It's also important to note that there are various reasons for rejecting various foods. Sometimes foods have unusual textures or flavors, but just as often they are rejected because of the associations of specific body parts (e.g., feet or snouts or tails being ""dirty,"" tongues because of their associations with animal feeding, genitals or reproductive organs for puritanical reasons, etc.). Or, in some cases the food perhaps resembles actual animal ""parts"" too much for our modern culture that is often divorced from butchering: in the era of the chicken ""nugget"" (or ""boneless skinless chicken breast"") and ground beef, an actual tongue or tail or ear tends to remind the eater that the food is not from some anonymous cut of ""meat"" but rather from an actual animal.


In some of these cases, the actual meat may not have a flavor or texture very different from the rest of the animal, but some people still reject it on the basis of its appearance or knowledge of its source within the animal. (An oxtail isn't very different in flavor or texture from short ribs or even some parts of the chuck after long cooking.)


A final connotation to ""offal"" referenced in the question is that of social class, which is also often associated with cooking techniques and cuisine types. A steak cut from a tenderloin can be cooked fast on a hot fire/grill and be tender and tasty in a matter of minutes, but the percentage of tender meat available from a cow is quite small and thus traditionally a meal for the elite. An oxtail generally requires hours of slow simmering in a stew or braise, traditionally a meal associated with lower classes. Also, many types of offal are more nutritious than ""regular"" meat (e.g., many internal organs) and/or have higher calories due to excess fat and connective tissue, which actually historically made them essential for lower classes to survive. (In less developed cultures in various parts of the world, these types of offal are quite frequently given to children or esteemed elders because of the recognition of their nutritional value.)


As the question points out, there has been a recent shift in some Western countries to embrace certain types of ""offal"" among middle and upper classes. Most cultures seem to maintain some random animal parts as delicacies (""sweetbreads"" being one example in Western culture), but the recent trend seems to be a combination of adventurous eating (popular in an era of multiculturalism) and a desire not to be ""wasteful."" However, despite the term ""offal"" with its etymological connection to waste, most ""offal"" has rarely been truly discarded. It just tends to be eaten by the people who like it or who don't have other things to eat.

",<food-safety><eggs><salmonella>,2012-05-13 14:23:40.867,23783,5,"If you need the eggs raw, you could submerge them in boiling water for 5 sec. That would kill any bacteria on the shell and the egg would still be raw inside. Put the eggs in cold water right away to prevent the egg from heating up by the residual heat in the shell. I have tried this many times and the eggs do not cook.
If you are serving the eggs to very young children, pregnant women or someone who are sick, you should buy pasteurized eggs instead. But normally it's safer to eat eggs from chickens you raise, than the ones from a factory, because they are more healthy and their immune system is well developed enough to kill the salmonella itself.

4,Why are olives always better at the restaurant?,"Between olives I've been served at restaurants as a starter and various brands of olives I bought in supermarkets I have found that the ones in restaurants often taste much better. In particular they are often less salty, less bitter and more buttery in taste. 


Is this a bias on my part, maybe because I tend to be more hungry when I go to a restaurant or are they actually better. Are there particular varieties of olives (eg. specific region or method of preservation or preparation) that taste like the ones in restaurants? Is it that they are fresher at a restaurant?


EDIT: I'm referring to plain olives here, not a processed. The [kind you get as a starter](http://i.imgur.com/y9gFpiq.jpg), sometimes with some bread on the side. In particular mediterranean or middle eastern restaurants serve them that way.


",<flavor><vegetables><restaurant-mimicry><olive>,2016-04-05 18:51:53.590,68038,5,"In comments you note that you last bought a jar of green, pitted olives in brine. Those tend to be much saltier than the versions served as a [*mezze*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meze) in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern restaurants, in part because the restaurant versions are usually whole and thus have less surface contact with the storage brine. They're also fresher; restaurants that go through larger quantities of olive can afford to purchase higher-quality olives that haven't been sitting in their brine on a shelf somewhere for months (or years).


Olive variety may also be a factor. The picture you've provided looks closest to me to a [Castelvetrano olive](http://www.delallo.com/articles/castelvetrano-olive), which have a very mild, almost buttery flavor. This mildness comes from its processing, which is close to the preparation of the black California olives familiar to Americans. They're washed in a lye solution, which flushes the bitterness of the fresh olive, and are then rinsed to remove any traces of lye; they can then be brined for a short period of time, but they're typically much fresher and less salty than other olives. I know a few chefs who like serving them as a starting course specifically because they're not overwhelmingly salty.


As others have suggested, you can seek out similar higher-quality olives in bulk at boutique grocery stores. You'll have to pay a bit more for the privilege, but the other advantage is that such stores are usually happy to let you try some of the varieties before you buy.

3,Vanilla Extract with and without alcohol,"Are there any reputable research regarding ranking of vanilla extracts? I usually buy major retail brand at supermarket. It tastes fine in baking. However, I add it to cream or tea and other non-baking recipes. In these recipes it tastes harsh. 


Is it the alcohol? I thought generic vanilla extract has flavorless alcohol?


Is it the brand? Has any major site (America's Test Kitchen, Culinary Schools) ranked vanilla extracts? 


Might in this case, artificial vanilla be better choice?


",<vanilla><extracts>,2019-04-08 18:36:27.517,97378,6,"According to the FDA vanilla extract must contain a **minimum** of 35 percent alcohol ([""TITLE 21--FOOD AND DRUGS""](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=169.3)). That's roughly on par with vodka. 


There's no such thing as flavorless alcohol. Ethanol has a flavor ([""Bitter and sweet components of ethanol taste in humans""](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10940547)) and alcohol (at least, when the dilution is greater than 35 percent) produces a burning sensation in the mouth and throat. Perhaps this is what you've identified as the harsh flavor.


There are pretty good alternatives, fortunately.


One option is vanilla flavoring. This is similar to vanilla extract, in that it's made from real vanilla beans, but it contains no or very low amounts of alcohol. Instead, the solvent will often be propylene glycol.1


The other very common option is what's sometimes called imitation vanilla, which is not made from vanilla beans, but instead from artificially produced vanillin. Such imitation flavorings may or may not contain alcohol. 


Vanillin is an organic compound that's responsible for the most prominent flavor in vanilla beans. It's produced naturally in the beans, and artificially through a number of different processes (which some people think aren't safe, but most of the concern I seen seems not to be grounded in science, but in a fear of ""chemicals""). Vanilla beans also contain a ton of other flavors, which is why imitation vanilla may be thought of as inferior. But, on the other hand, a lot of these other flavors can either be denatured or simply overpowered, especially when baked. The general advice I've heard (which may have come from America's Test Kitchen) is to use imitation vanilla in baking and vanilla extract for making things like whipped cream, where the vanilla is practically all you taste. 


Adding imitation vanilla to tea may not improve the flavor (over vanilla extract, that is), but it costs very little, so it wouldn't hurt to try.




---


1: As with so much in the online world, there's a lot of bad information out there about vanilla flavoring. For instance, look at what Eden Foods says about vanilla flavoring:



> 
> Natural Vanilla Flavor is an extract of many things using animal glycerin or propylene glycol (antifreeze) and a googol of other synthetic and/or toxic chemicals.

4,How to use cast-iron teacup?,"I love my cast-iron teapots; however, for Christmas, I received a set of teacups to match my latest acquisition. Do I pre-warm them like I do the pot? Or is the intent for it to leech some heat out when poured so it's drinkable faster? They appear to be traditional Chinese-style: small and without handles. They also appear to be enameled on the inside, to match the pot. 


Also, is there anything I should know about the care and keeping of them above and beyond the usual cast-iron advice (no soap, dry well, et cetera)?


",<equipment><tea>,2011-12-28 13:14:55.097,37017,3,"The cast iron tea equipment is a Japanese development. In Japan, tea is most commonly a green variety, and brewed at a lower temperature than boiling. This can be as low as 104˚F (40˚C) for high grades of gyokuro, or as high as 167˚F (75˚C) for more common varieties of sencha. 


The lower grade the tea, or the more oxidised/fermented the tea, the higher the temperature of the water recommended. In western tea culture, where black tea is the norm, the water used for tea preparation is usually boiling, 212˚F (100˚C), so if you are using cast iron equipment to prepare tea in the western fashion, you may be in for some burned fingers. This may also be the case for some Japanese ceramic tea services. I have one favourite Japanese stoneware tea cup that is equally likely to burn you if you put boiling water in it, unless you wait 5 minutes or more for it to cool.


In any case, the cost associated with cast iron tea services is such that they are more often used for more formal settings in which a higher grade of tea, and therefore, a lower water temperature, are more likely to be indicated.

2,Is there any food safety advantage in blanching meat prior to cooking sous-vide?,"There seems to be a lot of debate regarding the advantages of pre-searing meat prior to adding it to the water bath. I understand that the post-sear process is mainly for appearance and taste purposes, but some chefs I have watched have suggested that post (and pre) searing is essential for killing off any surface pathogens.


While this is fairly easy to accomplish with a thick cut of steak, with thinner cuts (and chicken breasts, for example) it is difficult to accomplish. 


While I have no intention of cooking below recommended pasteurization temperature/timings, for the acutely food safety conscious, would a 60 second blanch in boiling water prior to immersion be a sensible step? My reasoning here is there will still potentially be areas that do not reach sear temperature. Or is this only a useful technique if you intend to serve unpasteurized dishes?


",<food-safety><sous-vide>,2018-06-05 21:35:44.257,90188,3,"Pre-searing and post-searing are generally employed for crust formation on the final product. In fact, when cooking something like a steak, a pre-sear, followed by sous vide, finished with a post-sear allows quicker final crust formation. This reduces the possibility of over cooking your steak with the final sear. This works with poultry as well.


A quick blanch can be helpful when cooking meats at a low temperature, for a long time. This blanch eliminates lactobacillus, which is not harmful, but could cause off odors and bag inflation. For example when using a low temperature water bath (sous vide) to cook short ribs for, say, 48 hours...or something like oxtail, which I have done for as long as 100 hours, a quick blanch at the beginning drastically reduces any surface bacteria that might incubate and inflate the bag. Searing will serve the same purpose, but sometimes, with irregular cuts, it is difficult to sear all sides. Generally, I would suggest a very good sear, or a blanch when using low temperature, very-long duration (12 + hours) cooking situations.


Also, a quick blanch before cooking some vegetables will deactivate browning enzymes, and could be useful.

8,"Bread from the machine always too soft, can't be buttered","My bread machine (Panasonic SD-2501) makes good bread. The loaves rise every time and it has a great golden crust. However, the bread is always too soft.


The recipe:


* 1 tsp dry yeast
* 440gm baker's flour. I have also tried 00 pizza flour and 50/50 white/spelt blend
* 1 tsp bread improver (Wallaby brand)
* tablespoon honey
* tablespoon olive oil
* teaspoon salt
* 330ml milk or water (doesn't seem to make much difference)


I am adding the ingredients in that order as [Laucke suggests](http://www.laucke.com.au/FAQRetrieve.aspx?ID=53326).


The bread machine cycle is 5 hours and includes about 30 minutes of ""rest"" once the ingredients are in and the cycle kicks off. I don't know why, since it seems like wasted time when nothing has been mixed; it all just sits there.


Anyway, the problem is not just that the bread is too soft right when it comes out of the machine, though of course it is even softer then. The trouble is that the bread stays too soft to butter even a day later, with room temperature butter, so it is very difficult to make sandwiches with. The bread feels very light, and I think it could do with a lot more body - I don't like fluffy white bread from supermarkets and I want to make something with a bit more chew and resistance to tearing. Being too soft also means it doesn't toast well; the toasting seems to take a lot of moisture out of the bread, and when you bite it there's not much there at all.


",<bread><flour>,2016-05-04 00:49:03.837,68782,2,"Bread is given structure by gluten strands which stretch out and interlock. This is done mechanically by kneading and through the action of yeast, with yeast action being more important. If gluten is not well developed enough then you get a weak structure which can expand too much, if it is too developed then you get a tough bread. 


I think what is happening is that your dough is being proofed too quickly, and therefore you are not getting good gluten development. In my own personal experience this is a very common fault with bread machines as they warm the dough during the proofing cycle to speed it up. Whether you can fix this depends on the machine, you need to 1) stop the machine from heating the dough during rising and 2) extend the rising cycle if it's timed. If it's not timed but uses a height sensor then just turning off the heat will do. 


It's also possible that the machine is not kneading the dough enough, this also depends on the sophistication of your machine. Some machines do this on a timer, others sense the dough resistance. 


One suggestion I would make in general is to reduce the water in the recipe a bit as I think it's too wet. Try 300ml of water instead. I don't think this is **the** problem but too wet dough can balloon on you so it's worth a shot. 


Other possibilities are that your ingredients are inhibiting the yeast, however you are getting a good rise so I don't think that's particularly likely. You could try adding a bit less salt, and leaving out the oil and honey as an experiment.

0,Does adding baking soda to steam sweet potatoes in a pressure cooker help with caramelization?,"I recently discovered that adding baking soda to increase Ph in a pressure cooker promotes the Maillard reaction (see [article](https://www.multiculturiosity.com/on-the-wonders-of-pressure-cookers-baking-soda-and-modernist-cuisines-caramelized-carrot-soup/), and [this answer](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/29692/52000)), and I want to try this with steamed sweet potatoes.


In both links, the food is submerged in the higher-Ph liquid. Could I achieve a similar result with steaming, by dissolving (possibly more) baking soda in the water, or does the food *have* to be in contact with the higher Ph environment? 


",<pressure-cooker><steaming><caramelization><sweet-potatoes><maillard>,2020-04-01 16:20:43.477,107209,3,"The need for contact is correct, but not really the issue here (else you could have pre-rubbed your potatoes). Both caramelization and Maillard reaction (which are different things) require rather high temperatures. The reason to use steaming as a technique is to not get up to these temperatures. In traditional steaming, you only get your food to 100°C. In a pressure cooker, you can steam the food quicker, but even in an old fashioned pressure cooker at sea level\*, you never get above 120 Celsius, which is not enough for any browning - and that's a feature, not a bug. 


If you want Maillard reaction, or caramelization, you should choose a cooking method that can achieve that, such as roasting or pan-frying. If you are having trouble with pan-frying (e.g. having the outside burn while the center of the sweet potato chunks is still raw), you can first brown your food in a pan and then cook through with other methods such as braising, simmering or steaming. 


You can, in principle, add baking soda during a browning step, but for me, the change in taste is not worth it. Normal browning gives you plenty of tasty crust on its own.

You'll likely want a 'broiler pan' so that you can drain the grease away from the food (and catch it so it doesn't light on fire). They're under $20 online.


1. Set the rack of the oven so that the food will be about 2"" from the upper heating element.
2. Heat the broiler on its hottest setting, but leave the door to the oven open.
3. Place the food in the oven, but again, don't close it.
4. Turn the food occasionally until it's cooked to the level you want.


As for the bit about not closing the door : 
If you close the door to the oven, it might heat up too much, and shut off. You need the element actively heating, so that you have radiant heating, not convection or conduction. (this is also why you want the food really close to the heating element). Note that this is for electric ovens -- I don't think gas ovens have the same issue.

You could also try to sterilize the flour (pressure cooker / oven).


Note: air contains wild yeast cells and lactic acid bacteria. So the chances that they contaminate your culture is high.


Also note: if the culture is not well aerated, it produces alcohol, which in turn attracts acetobacter, which turn the alcohol into acetic acid.


When culturing mushrooms, the growers try to make sure that the selected mushroom strain is the one, that colonizes the substrate first, because it can then outcompete moulds and bacteria. I think if you have a high yeast ratio, it might be able to outcompete lactobacilli. This way you could probably use flour without having to worry that it turns sour.


Edit: lactic acid bacteria likes [anaerobic](https://www.researchgate.net/post/Why_are_Lactic_acid_bacteria_cultured_anaerobically) conditions, in the presence of O2 it forms H2O2 which limits its growth. This could also be used to improve your LAB/yeast ratio.

Pressure canning of cubed (but not mashed or pureed) pumpkin is also possible (as pumpkin is a low acid fruit, boiling water canning is not appropriate). You should use only a [trusted recipe](http://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_04/pumpkin_winter_squash.html) if you choose to go this route.


You can also make [pumpkin leather](http://nchfp.uga.edu/how/dry/veg_leathers.html), although this does not to leave the pumpkin suitable for many recipes, and is only suitable if this the actual product you desire.

5,Why does salted cod turn chewy?,"We recently bought half a salted codfish. I did a Spanish recipe ([and asked a question about it](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/7375/spanish-codfish-with-sous-vide)). The fish had a very nice texture (although it was way too salty).


This weekend, my wife did the same Spanish recipe, with the same codfish... but the texture of the flesh was chewy (her fish was less salty). 


Any idea why? My guess is that the fish was overcooked. But I'm not sure.


",<fish><spanish-cuisine><cod>,2010-10-04 14:13:44.810,8252,2,"Assuming the cod was the same quality as before and you de-salted the fish in the fridge for 24 to 48 hours, then I would also guess overcooking. Rendering the gelatin at 45°C (as suggested in the paper [@yossarian uncovered](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/7375/spanish-codfish-with-sous-vide/7383#7383)) should prevent the fish from cooking and give enough time to get it into the oil. You can always cook the fish in a separate step after you made the pil pil.


Modern techniques for salting cod use less salt and create a product that will not be edible by future archeologists, so store in a dry cool place (tightly wrapped in the fridge).

3,Do ground seeds contain oil?,"I am referring to things like cumin seeds or others which are meant to contain oil. When they are ground does it loose the oil? Or does the oil exist but it deteriorates due to oxidation?


I also understand raw tumeric contains oil. Does that also go once it's ground or does that oxidise too?


I am asking about if you ground at home and store bought powders.


",<oil><ground>,2019-11-01 02:00:20.233,103212,6,"So, let's first get clear about what ""oil"" means. In common language there are two ""oils"" contained in food: ""oil"" and ""essential oils"". 


""Oil"" means the common, cooking liquid fat, that has a more neutral taste and is used for various applications (deep-frying, stir frying...). Main composition of this is unsaturated fats, and the oil comes from the so-called oleiferous plants, which are plants that use oil as nutrition storage for their sprouts - e.g. peanuts, sunflower, canola, olive, flax seed, soy...


""Essential oils"" have a very different composition and application - they contain a very diverse mix of components that give spices, herbs, flowers and other seasonings their caracteristic aroma (or ""essence""). These components are usually volatile and present in very small quantities in the natural product, and of course, since they're present in very small quantities in the seed / herb, you need a *lot* of it to make a portion of essential oil, therefore, those are really expensive. 
One of the methods for extracting this oil is to steep the aromatic (spice / herb / flower) in common oil or fat - then you get aromatized oil in a quantity you can handle with more ease. 


When you hear that cumin seeds and turmeric (which is a root, not a seed) contain oil, we're talking about the *essential* oil. The oil is there, in a very small quantity, that's the reason why you cannot see it with the naked eye, unless you grind *large* quantities of the seed very finely to directly obtain the oil. You're also right on oxidation and evaporation - this is why pre-ground spice loses its punch very quicker than the whole thing.

2,How do I quickly get okra to stop being goopy?,"It's irritating to cook any recipe with okra. I love okra, but it always takes a long time to burn off all the goopy stuff. Is there a way to get rid of it more quickly so my okra will be ready sooner?

1,Complete list of terms used to describe cooking methods?,"I am trying to build up a list of all the cooking methods which can be used to cook something, including terms used in the stages of the cooking process used to cook such food. Here is what I have come up with so far:


* boiling
* simmering
* steaming
* poaching
* sweating
* braising
* frying
* shallow-frying
* stir-frying
* deep-frying
* refrying
* toasting
* broiling
* stewing
* charbroiling
* grilling
* sauteéing
* browning
* baking
* marinading
* pickling
* macerating


Is there anything else which can be added to this list (or where can I find a complete list of these in English (I expect these terms to differ a little bit from language to language, even with some incompatibilities, given that different cultures are associated with cooking methods that to some extent would differ), and if such book or other source is proprietary than could someone please quote from it and post an answer)? Thanks.


",<language>,2015-06-28 04:54:29.930,58619,2,"I think any ""exhaustive"" list here is bound to be arbitrary. Some of your own categories overlap (e.g., frying, plus several subcategories of such); so, e.g., is ""slow cooking"" a cooking method or is it the same as simmering? Is frying in a wok (aka. stir frying) a distinct method from what you call ""shallow-frying""? I would say it is, which makes me think of [your other question regarding ""frying in water""](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/58573/culinary-term-for-frying-in-water-without-oil): Could it have a distinct name as a style of boiling or streaming? I don't see why not, but I do not think there is one.


Anyway, here's a few:


* Roasting
* Basting
* Smoking
* Blanching
* [Sous vide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sous-vide)
* [Pit barbecue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_barbecue)
* Reducing as in a [reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(cooking))


Finally, although it does not involve heat and thus might not be ""cooking"", **marinading ceviche,** since it achieves the same denaturation via acid, still seems like a form of cooking to me.


I'd think baking has a lot of distinct subcategories too -- what does a waffle iron count as?

18,Is there any advantage to combining spices before applying them to meat?,"Up to this point when preparing steaks, ribs, or any sort of ""meat"" I would apply my spices in sequence: first adding salts, followed by a pepper-based powders, and lastly some sugars (if applicable).

1,Is mixing coffee with milk directly unhealthy?,"Scientifically speaking, is there a reason not to mix coffee with milk directly? 


I remember reading once, that milk is like the antidote to coffee and there is a bio-chemical reason why this makes an unhealthy mixture.


A reference would be appreciated.


",<coffee><milk>,2012-01-11 10:10:18.620,20362,10,"Not really, but there haven't been that many studies in to the issue. An abstract of the most significant one can be found [here](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/140/2/259.abstract).


To summarise, the study tested people who had drunk black coffee, coffee with milk, and coffee with non-dairy creamer to see how much of the phenolic acid (one constituent of coffee that is supposed to have health benefits) entered the bloodstream in each case.


The study found that adding milk had no effect, but adding creamer affected the maximum concentration of the phenols in blood plasma, and the time it took to achieve that concentration.


This kind of toing and froing over the health of certain foods is rife today. One minute coffee is bad for you, the next it's good for you, and so on. For example, the study above assumes that the phenolic acids involved, being antioxidants, are good for you because they reduce free radicals in the body. 


Free radicals in too high a concentration can indeed be harmful. However, they are also an essential part of the immune system - when a harmful bacteria is found in the body, phagocyte cells will surround it and destroy it with free radicals, for example. Things like this mean that there is rarely a simple answer to questions of food health.


Likewise, it has been suggested that people with a certain set of genes may be adversely affected by drinking too much caffeine, which may cause bone loss, *unless* they also have a source of calcium, like milk, in their diet as well, which would rather suggest that milk is definitely a good thing to have with your coffee!

12,Finding cheap but quality steak for grill,"We recently moved to a nice apartment building with great rooftop grills. I have started to learn about grilling, and it was a mistake, as now I really like prime ribeye steak off the grill (I think, we buy Whole Foods, grade 3 meat)


The problem is that such steaks are relatively expensive, at $13-19/pound.


Is there any trick to finding good quality meat at lower prices apart from waiting for discounts? Can cheaper steak be prepared to similar quality/taste as better cuts on the grill, if I like form-factor of rib eye?


",<steak><shopping>,2018-11-28 23:43:39.983,94343,22,"There are a few things that you can do:


* **Buy in bulk**. There's typically a major discount for buying a 'family pack' (usually 5+ lbs) at once. I like shopping at Wegman's, because they sell steaks that are on sheets where each one's individually wrapped, so I can leave some sealed for later in the week or even freeze them.
* **Shop at more than one store**. They all have their sales each week, and you have potentially more deals if you hit one on the weekend but a different one (not in the same chain) on your way home from work mid-week.
* **Look for 'must sell' packages**. When the package gets within a day or two of the 'sell by' date, most stores will mark them. It's often half price, but I've seen it anywhere from 30-70% off. Some stores will slap them with bright yellow or orange price tags and put them back in the section they came from, while others will have a place in the meat department that's only the must-sell packages.
* **Cut your own steaks**. For some cuts of meat, you can get roasts, and they're often at a cheaper cost than steaks. You'll just have to cut them to an appropriate size yourself. (don't do this if you don't have any large knives). For ribeye, look for a 'boneless rib roast' or 'standing rib roast' if you want it on the bone. For some cuts, you can get a half primal in a cryovac bag, but it's a more limited selection unless you go to a warehouse style store (Costco, BJs, etc.)
* **Buy different cuts of meat**. Rib eye tends to be one of the more expensive steak cuts. There are a few websites out there that have recommendations for more economical steaks:


	+ <http://www.thenibble.com/reviews/main/meats/beef/best-value-steak-cuts.asp> (their top three are boneless blade, thin flank, and tri-tip)
	+ <https://www.mashed.com/24540/best-cuts-steak-budget/> (chuck eye, flat iron, tri-tip)

	+ <https://www.thekitchn.com/5-budget-cuts-of-beef-you-should-be-buying-according-to-a-butcher-240281> (chuck eye, flat iron, hanger)One thing to remember is that the less intramuscular fat, the more rare that you should cook it. For lean cuts that come from working muscles, you'll need to slice it thinly across the grain so it's not too tough.

The filtering helps on the flavor department. As food particles/breadings fall off, they burn and impart a burnt flavor. If you reuse oil with much burnt parts, the burnt flavors will come through lot quicker.


**Alternate to cheesecloths:** 
If you notice hardly any food particles in the bottom, you are good to go. if you have food particles, I can suggest either


1. Pour the oil slowly to another vessel, leaving the last half inches or so, and the food particles will remain in that last bit of oil. Discard that oil and use the remaining oil.
2. Use paper towel to filter.

13,What to do with a failed cake?,"Yesterday, my wife baked a cake. Unfortunately, it was a disastrous fail. Instead of fluffy and juicy it turned out to be a compact and painfully chewy mass (not to say mess). It is so compact that the raisins lying around started orbiting it. 


Now we were discussing on how to utilize it. Flushing it down the toilet is no option, since it is still food and we are worried about the damage it might cause to the pipes. The organic waste bin might be a way to dispose of it, however, I'd feel sorry about throwing out all the valuable ingredients.

44,Stock vs Broth - What's the difference in usage?,"I've now learned (from this site) that broth and stock are not the same product (see [this great answer](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/2960/use-any-part-of-an-animal-for-making-stock-broth/2970#2970)). 


So, in any given scenario, why should one use stock rather than broth, or vice versa?  

i.e. What's the practical difference? 


EDIT: I'm mostly looking for when to use one vs the other.


",<language><stock><broth>,2010-07-23 13:27:50.103,3269,36,"**Classification and use of Stocks vs. Broth:**


Broths are the result of cooking meat, not just bones. They're generally the result of preparing another item and usually not prepared specifically on their own. The juices poured off from a roasted turkey (after being degreased) would be considered broth. Whole chickens being poached for another preparation would create broth.


Stocks are made from just the bones. They are prepared specifically for use in other recipes (sauces, soups, stews, rice, etc.) Stocks are never salted in their preparation or the finished dish will most likely end up too salty due to reduction that will take place upon further cooking. Note that homemade stock will be often a bit more broth-like than restaurant/commercial stocks, since it's really hard to get all the meat off the bones.


Stocks are usually simmered for a very long time (4-6 hours for chicken & 8-12 for veal/beef) to extract maximum flavor and gelatin from the bones.


Broths aren't usually cooked nearly as long due to the fact that cooking the meat for extended periods (even chicken surrounded by the liquid) will result in tough, flavorless meat.


Consomme: a fortified and clarified stock. The stock is fortified in flavor by the addition of a ""raft"" which is a combination of lean ground meat (appropriate to the type of stock being used) with brunoise (1/16 inch) mirepoix (carrots, onions, celery), and egg whites. The raft mixture is stirred into the cold stock and as it gently heats, the proteins coagulate forming a ""raft"" on top of the stock. A small hole is poked in the center (if one hasn't already formed) and as the stock bubbles through the hole it leaches back through the ground meat/egg white raft which filters out impurities to clarify the stock and fortify it with flavor.


Bouillon: French word for broth.


Court Bouillon: sometimes called a ""short broth"". A poaching liquid usually used for fish that is usually comprised of water, acid (lemon juice, vinegar, wine), parsley stems, bay leaves, peppercorns, and some salt.


When to use Stock vs. Broth:
Use stock when a sauce is to be reduced significantly or when clarity of the final result is preferred.


Broths can be substituted for stock when the body of the liquid or clarity isn't important, and when the liquid will be thickened by addition of a starch.

2,Overnight cooking: Is sous-vide safer than electrical oven?,"I am a fan of bone broths, but always have a problem with the overnight cooking part.


For the overnight cooking part I have the following options:


* Interrupt cook, let the pot hot on the stove, continue in the morning (this is what I am doing now)
* Cook overnight on the stove (this seems to be a bad idea)
* Cook in an oven overnight. Some people say, that this is a lot safer, than the stove, but I am not willing to do it.
* Stand-alone stove on the balcony. I actually believe, that this should be pretty safe.
* My latest idea: Put the bone broth pot in a big container full of water and heat the water with a sous-vide circulator.


Since sous-vide circulators can not reach as high temperatures as an oven and since they are, after all, in a container full of water, is it safe to assume, that overnight sous-vide is safer than overnight oven cooking? I could make it even safer, by putting the whole thing on the balcony, however this would probably increase energy consumption dramatically.


",<oven><sous-vide><broth><bones>,2019-04-27 22:00:23.020,98722,4,"On top of the stove the issue is boiling dry. At that point the temperature can rise almost unchecked. This will result in unpleasant fumes at best, flames at worst. Even in the latter case, because you should be using a fairly tight fitting lid, everything should be contained, but I wouldn't rely on that.


The oven is different. Once the pot is up to boiling point you can set an oven temperature of just over 100°C. In the unlikely event of boiling dry, the contents still won't exceed that temperature - no burning. Like you I assume an electric oven.


Using a sous vide circulator you'll actually struggle to get the inner pot hot enough - you generally want a gentle simmer for broth/stock. The outer pot will loose a lot to evaporation even if it never boils.


I'd have more confidence in the oven, but if you're shopping there's one more option - a slow cooker. Making stock is trivial: put in bones (and any veg etc.); pour over boiling water; leave on high for a few hours or low for up to a couple of days; strain. I normally use low overnight for chicken stock with onion, celery, & herbs. These are specifically designed to run for long periods unattended without boiling dry (as the power input is low and the lid fits tightly).

Bacteria already have plenty to eat. There is a lot of sugar in milk. Cow's milk is 4-5% sugar. Additionally, giving the bacteria more to eat would allow them to create more acid and make the product more sour not less.


The bacteria used in yogurt making are lactobacilli and prefer munching on lactose anyway.


That said; Lactose tastes less sweet than the sucrose in table sugar. Adding sucrose will make the yogurt sweeter if that is your taste.


Making the yogurt thicker is done by

* using higher fat milk,
* adding protein in the form of dry milk powder,

3,Color changes in ground beef?,"So this sounds lame, but I have never cooked burgers before. Well my dad came over and since it's my first house I purchased we did the traditional grill out. I bought a charcoal grill and he showed me the ropes etc.

Burgers were good and no pink (well maybe very very slightly) in the middle, but thats generally how I like them (Btw is ""Medium"" aka little pink ""technically"" safe?)


Anyways i've heard that color is not a good indicator of doneness, but the meat was bought that day and used immediatly (so it was red) and apparently the color not being a good indicator is only valid the the meat has been stored for awhile?


Is this true/untrue? I guess im just a bit paranoid.


Thanks


",<food-safety><meat>,2015-08-09 01:43:20.077,59743,2,"You are correct in saying using color to determine doneness is less reliable in older meat. As the meat is exposed to air, it oxidizes giving it a brownish color. When checking for doneness, people sometimes see this oxidized brown color and mistaken it for being fully cooked through. However, this can occur for fresher meats also.


According to the USDA using color is not recommended to determine the doneness of hamburgers.

> Some ground beef may appear to have lost all pink color before it is fully cooked. If raw ground beef is somewhat brown already, it may look fully cooked before it reaches a safe temperature.

So it is really recommended that you get a meat thermometer to test the doneness of your burgers in the future.


With all that said, unless you have really thick giant burger patties(10oz +), cooking the burger at 300F for 15-20 minutes should definitely be enough time to insure that the burgers are fully cooked through.

What difference does the type of stove - induction vs electric - make to the actual cooking process? 


",<equipment><stove><electric-stoves><induction>,2010-08-11 00:15:32.053,4841,31,"A regular electric oven uses a large coiled resistor as a heating element. A large electric current is passed through this element which generates heat, similar to the tungsten filament of an incandescent light bulb.


An induction stove doesn't actually generate heat itself, but rather *induces* it the pot or pan. It does this using a rapidly oscillating magnetic field. This field induces an electric current in a ferromagnetic pan which generates heat, thus heating the food.


Induction stoves are faster, safer, and more energy efficient than traditional electric stoves. It requires significantly less electricity to create the magnetic field than it does to drive enough current through a resistor to make it heat up. They are safer because they don't actually generate heat themselves. After taking a pot off the ""burner"" (glass surface) it quickly begins to cool.


With regards to differences in the cooking process, there's not much. You just need to be aware that it heats up much more quickly and cools down much more quickly than a traditional electric stove. It does affect your choice of pans however. All aluminum pans will not work, nor will some lower quality stainless steel ones. If a magnet sticks to the pan then it will work just fine. The pan must also have a flat bottom to make full contact with the surface.

In this case, you might want to try some sort of tart lemon glaze or perhaps a very bittersweet chocolate icing to compliment your cookies and reduce the impression of sweetness. On the other hand, except for butter, sugar cookies contain no expensive ingredients. It may not be worth trying to salvage this batch.


In the end, this is probably a lesson learned that your particular recipe is not to your liking as is. Next time, you will want to either reduce the sugar, or use another recipe.

4,how to get rid the sourness in yogurt,"My question is about making yogurt at home. I made yogurt at home but there is some problem which causes the yogurt to taste sour. I tried lots of methods to prevent the sourness because I don't like the sourness in yogurt. But unfortunately, I have failed to achieved the expected results. What should i do to make a perfect yogurt at home?


",<yogurt>,2018-10-23 01:11:10.937,93159,9,"If you want less sour yogurt, you have to pick the right culture and right process. 


* First, choose a streptococcus culture, or maybe bifida. Lactobacilicus bulgaricus gives you more sour yogurt.
* Second, go as low as your culture allows you. The manufacturer will have given you the range at which your culture can be incubated, choose something at the lower end. But of course make sure that whatever setup you are using can really hold the temperature in range - for example, if you have a culture that can go from 40 to 46 Celsius, but your apparatus has temperature swings of 1.5 degrees Celsius, don't set it to 40, set it to 42.
* Third, time. Here, you have to see what is the shortest time you can incubate and have the yogurt set. It is a matter of trial and error with a given temperature and culture. [Moscafj's answer](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/93158/4638) suggests 5 hours as a starting point for experimentation.
* Fourth, storage time. Your yogurt can keep going slightly more sour in the fridge. So don't make more than one week's worth ahead.
* Fifth, make sure that your starting temperature is also correct. I have a relative who is too impatient to wait for the yogurt cool down properly before innoculating, and never uses a thermometer, she just adds the culture to the too hot milk. Her yogurt always reeks of acetic acid to levels I can't tolerate.


If you get your variables right as described above, your yogurt can be pretty mild.

8,What makes pineapples cause a burning / itchy feeling in the mouth?,"Years ago the pineapple pieces I used to cut had something that caused an itchy / burning feeling in the mouth. After I heard that maybe some substances in the rind cause this irritation and I should clean the knife after every cut, the itchy / burning feeling never occurred again ... until today. Today I had a quite ripe pineapple. 


What substances cause this feeling? How do I avoid them? If the substance really come from the rind: Is rinsing the pineapple pieces a good way to get rid of this nasty stuff?


",<pineapple>,2014-11-12 13:22:02.093,49716,9,"Human skin contains oils which aid in blocking out the absorption of chemicals which would harm or irritate the skin. Those oils contain proteins. Pineapple contains a chemical compound called [bromelain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromelain) which has the ability to break down these proteins. This is bad, because it can then act on the skin itself (which is also comprised of protein molecules).


On top of that, pineapple is high in citric acid. The tingling/itching/burning sensation you describe is no doubt the result of both of these things acting upon the skin at the same time. Understandably, eating pineapple with (or after) meat high in oil content (such as pork at a luau) will mitigate against these effects.


Since there's no escaping this problem through the use of cutlery, there must have been some other factor at play to which you didn't make attribution at the time. In other words, some other factor was involved in slowing down or preventing the appearance of the undesired effects, such as the one I mentioned above.


In the old plantation South there's a tradition which involves giving pineapple as a gift to guests who are on the verge of overstaying their welcome. No doubt this is because the remarkable sweetness of pineapple is, quite soon enough, followed by a predictable unpleasantness.

5,Is charcoal or the smoker at fault for low temperature smoking?,"I recently received a charcoal smoker for my cake day. I attempted to smoke pork ribs, here are the steps I followed. 


1. Cured the smoker with 2 Lbs of charcoal. (6 hours)
2. Cleaned the smoker.
3. Prepped 3 Lbs of charcoal in charcoal chimney.
4. Put water used to soak hickory chips in the water reservoir.
5. Position ribs on the two racks
6. Once charcoal was red hot with white ash, transferred it to the charcoal pan.
7. Smoked for about 5 hours and temperature started dropping.
8. Added 2 Lbs more of Charcoal Chimney prepped charcoal.
9. Smoked for 3 more hours.


The problem I experienced is the temperature never went above 180F (82C), at the end of the 8 hours total smoking time, the internal temperature of the ribs sat at 120F (49C).
I ended up finishing them off in an oven set to 360F (182C) for about 25 minutes to raise the meats internal temperature to 145F (62C).


Is the charcoal at fault for the temperature?
I used: `Cowboy Brand Hardwood Lump Charcoal` 


Is the smoker the issue?
I used: `Char-Broil Vertical Charcoal Smoker`


One note, the smoker smoked from around the door to what I would think might be excessive. Should I look into sealing around the door? This smoker has no smoke stack on it's top.


Ribs turned out great either way, but finishing them in the oven caused fat to drip into the bottom of the oven and now the wife is mad because when we use it, it smokes the house.

The pan that holds the charcoal does not allow for proper air flow to the fuel. Contrast this with a Weber grill, where you put your fuel on an elevated grate with plenty of air beneath it. This Char Broil instead just has a pan that you put on a shelf. Before long your coals are buried in ash, and barely smoldering. FWIW, if you were to attempt sealing the doors, it would only exacerbate your problem, as the issue is with not enough air, versus too much. I replaced my Char Broil with a Weber Smokey Mountain, but I had considered some hacks to make it better. Your best bet would be to ditch the pan-on-shelf system, and fashion your own charcoal grate that is elevated from the bottom of the smoker. You want something that will both allow air flow to the fuel and allow the ashes to fall away from the fuel. Then you would be able to properly manage temperatures with the air vents.

6,"What is the difference between ""Mongolian Grill"" and ""Hibachi""?","For years I have been frequenting Chinese restaurants that feature ""Mongolian Grill"" (or Mongolian BBQ depending on the location). Recently I tried a new place that had (what they called) ""Hibachi"", which looked very similar, and I originally mistook for 'the same'. When I inquired about the Mongolian grill I was informed that there is a difference. While the host went on about what those differences are I am afraid that the subtleties were ""lost in translation"".


*Can someone clarify for me what the differences are?*


",<chinese-cuisine><japanese-cuisine>,2011-09-07 14:01:01.997,17556,16,"Hibachi are technically a traditional Japanese device used for heating one's house. They are a basic, heat-proof container that holds charcoal.


![A hibachi.](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xAzCD.jpg)


The cooking devices that many people *refer* to as ""hibachi"" are what the Japanese would call ""[shichirin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shichirin)"":


![A shichirin.](https://i.stack.imgur.com/fqj23.jpg)


I'm guessing that the term ""hibachi"" was popularized in North America because [""shichirin"" can be hard to pronounce for Anglophones](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Shichirin.ogg).


Somewhere along the way, primarily in North America, the term ""hibachi"" also started to be used to refer to [teppanyaki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teppanyaki):


![Teppanyaki.](https://i.stack.imgur.com/WLp0D.jpg)


I'm not sure when or why this started; perhaps it has something to do with the fact that [Banihana](http://www.benihana.com/) confusingly refers to their teppanyaki restaurants as ""hibachi-style"".


Among these, teppanyaki is most similar to [Mongolian barbecue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_barbecue), in which meat is cooked on large, round, cast iron griddles:


![Mongolian barbecue.](https://i.stack.imgur.com/fo2S7.jpg)


(Images taken from Wikipedia.)


If you were to actually go to a Japanese restaurant and cook your own food over a shichirin, it would likely be referred to as ""[yakiniku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakiniku)"", which is believed to have some origins in [Korean barbecue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_barbecue).


Whereas teppanyaki has been a traditional Japanese cooking method for a long time, ""Mongolian barbecue"" was developed in the 1970s in Taipei, Taiwan. During that time, Japanese Teppanyaki was very popular in Taiwan, so many people speculate that was actually the inspiration for Mongolian barbecue. There are also some similarities between the Japanese dish ""[jingisukan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingisukan)"" and Mongolian barbecue, however, jingisukan predates Mongolian barbecue.

* The longer food is in the freezer the greater your chance of freezer burn


I'm going to go out on a limb though and guess that—at least with your ice cubes may just be acquiring a ""freezer smell"" from the other foods in your freezer. If I don't use the cubes in my freezer fast enough they end up tasting really unpleasant. Give your freezer a good cleaning and cover your ice cubes with saran wrap and this should help stop the funny smells/tastes.

As to whether to put them in a sealed container or not, it depends on the cookie. The harder type does all right in the air, and can get flaccid in a sealed container. If they are soft, they are probably better off covered. It is still preferable to not isolate them completely, a canvas bag or a bread box with ventilation slits does better.

9,Making apfelschorle,"Apfelschorle is a German (or Austrian?) drink which is made with approximately a 1:1 ratio of apple juice and sparkling (carbonated) mineral water. 


My technique is simply to pour the appropriate amount of apple juice and water (both chilled) into a cup, give it a stir, and then drink. 


When I had bottled Apfelschorle in Germany (primarly two brands: Gerolsteiner and Lift), the bubbles were delicate and small, like in a bottle of champagne. I preferred the Gerolsteiner brand, which had a bit more delicate bubbles and better apple flavor. 


I've tried making it at home in the US with an approximately 1:1 ratio of seltzer water (La Croix brand) and apple juice (Mott's brand). The flavor is close to Lift (I suspect higher quality apple juice would give a better depth of flavor and the mineral content is different as well which might also affect the flavor) which is acceptable, but the mouthfeel is all wrong -- the bubbles are typically big and don't last as long as either Lift or Gerolsteiner; only a few sips have the right mouthfeel. 


Is there a way to get the right mouthfeel without resorting to buying (expensive in the US) European mineral waters? 


I drink a decent amount of seltzer water, so even if it requires equipment to carbonate water at home, I might be willing to invest in it. 


",<substitutions><water><juice><german-cuisine><carbonation>,2017-07-03 20:13:24.620,82788,6,"You are comparing two rather different things. A mixture of apple juice and water that is then carbonated (as your bottled product would be) is quite different from a mixture of still apple juice and carbonated water.


I know that both alcoholic and non-alcoholic carbonated cider/apple juice typically have small bubbles. And you can purchase carbonated apple juice in the US, (often seen/marketed as a non-alcoholic alternative to champagne) as well as an increasingly wide variety of alcoholic ciders.


I don't know how mixing carbonated juice and carbonated water would work out, but it would have much better odds of being somewhat like what you want. For even better odds, start with an empty, chilled bottle (suitable for carbonated drinks) and pour both ingredients into it, then seal the top and let them meld in the fridge under pressure for a while (perhaps a day), rather than stirring in an open cup. That MIGHT even work for the still juice, although it would be limited in carbonation.


If you got a carbonation system of some sort, you could start with apple juice and water mixed, and then force carbonate that.

Pine nuts are very expensive here. I'm wondering if I can substitute any of the following:

",<substitutions><italian-cuisine><nuts>,2011-09-10 16:08:19.847,17641,12,"First, I'm assuming by ""pesto"" you mean ""Pesto alla Genovese"", given your question about pine nuts. Basil, pine nuts, garlic, olive oil, and cheese is a delicious combination, but it's only one of many ""pestos"" (peste, actually), since pesto refers in general to any sauce which is made from crushed or pureed ingredients. Mix and match to your heart's content. 


Walnuts are actually a traditional alternative to pine nuts for Pesto alla Genovese; pine nuts have always been scarce, even in early-20th-century Italy. As a caution, though, you need to get good, fresh walnuts and make sure to get all of the skin off the nuts, or the pesto will taste bitter and rancid.


Almonds could also work, although I'd think they'd be rather bland. The herb pastes which traditionally have crushed almonds -- such as Romanesco sauce -- include some hot pepper. Again, freshness and getting the skin off is important.


I'd think sunflower seeds would be kind of odd and oily, but you don't know until you try. If you do, post a comment to let us know!

27,Does resting the dough for a long time reduce the need to knead the bread?,"In this [article](http://www.chefmichaelsmith.ca/en/home/MichaelsJournal/realbreadstory.aspx) by Chef Michael Smith, he mentions a recipe where leaving the dough to rest for 18 hours removes the need to knead the bread. Is this a viable alternative? I've tried the recipe and found that the bread was more dense than a properly kneaded dough.


",<baking><bread><dough>,2010-07-09 19:21:06.197,95,10,"Kneading does two things. First it mixes all the ingredients uniformly. You have to do this no matter what, but you only really have to do it enough to mix the ingredients.


If you keep kneading beyond the mixing stage, you are applying energy (which equals heat) to the yeast which makes it ferment, generating the tiny bubbles which make bread fluffy.


The yeast will ferment on its own, but kneading just accelerates that process.


Historically, dough was proved (left in a hot humid place) for about 18 hours allowing it to rise slowly in order to make bread.


In 1961 a process was developed in England called the [Chorleywood Process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorleywood_bread_process). Essentially you work the heck out of the dough with high-speed mixers. The extra few minutes of high energy mixing applies heat to the yeast, which dramatically reduces the fermentation period required, allowing you to make bread much more quickly... at factory-type speeds. Factories can make bread in a couple of hours instead of having to prepare dough one day and bake it the next.

",<breading>,2019-05-05 18:44:49.547,98830,5,"The best thing to do is to season the tofu itself (after pressing & drying it).


I'm going to use a bunch of example fried fish recipes here, but the same principles apply to tofu, or frankly anything you coat and fry.


Many recipes for breaded and fried whatever [have you season the flour](https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/fried-tilapia/16325/?utm_term=.9157378d4474) or the batter, and not the item. This is generally a mistake, because seasoning the flour or the coating means that you have no real control over how much seasoning ends up on each piece, and that the item ends up rather bland (particularly a problem with tofu), and you waste a lot of spices when you throw away the leftover coating. This is why I almost always use the following procedure:


1. Dry the item to be fried;
2. Season it with my seasonings;
3. Flour, batter, and/or coat it as applicable.


So, why do recipes have you season the flour, batter, or coating? There's a few reasons for this:


* It's traditional (check the back of a box of Zatrain's Fish Fri), and people don't think about what they're doing, they just follow the recipe.
* Seasoning the item seems like an extra step in what's already a 4-step process.
* The breading is heavy, and they want it to be spicy, not just the contents.


Only the last reason makes any sense. You can see a good example of thinking about this [in this fish recipe](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/20107/beer-batter-fish-made-great/), where the author seasons the fish and then seasons the coating *as well*. This helps ensure that the thick breading is flavorful as well as the fish.


So, in conclusion: season the item, not the coating, unless the coating is heavy breading, in which case you should season *both* the item and the breading.

1. What should I look for when purchasing a whetstone?
2. Should I buy a lower-end set of knives to practice on first?
3. Why would one opt to use an electric sharpener over a whetstone?


",<equipment><knives><maintenance>,2013-07-23 01:17:47.233,35502,12,"A stone is the hardest way to sharpen a knife. If you don't get the angle exactly right, you'll just be messing up your knife, not sharpening it. If you do want to go that way, yes, you'd definitely want to practice on something cheaper, because it's likely you will mess it up. This is why a lot of people just take their expensive knives to a professional to get sharpened. I've seen good knives sharpened into oblivion before - totally reshaped blades, and still not even really sharp.


Most electric sharpeners are designed to avoid all this - the good ones have a fixed angle sharpening surface, and something to hold the knife in the right orientation, so you can't mess it up. The one caveat is that Western style knives have 20° edges, while Japanese style ones have 15° edges, so for example in the US, the sharpeners you buy won't be good for Japanese style knives.


Additionally, you don't actually need to sharpen them very often at all. Periodically honing your knife will keep it pretty darn sharp, especially if it's a decent knife and you take good care of it otherwise. Give that a try, and you may not feel you need to sharpen it for a long while. At that point, since you won't be sharpening it all that many times in your life, it may not be worth learning to sharpen the hard way - a professional or an electric sharpener will be a lot easier.


But if you do want to get a stone and teach yourself, the thing to do is probably to start with a finer-grained one, so you can't destroy the knife as easily. You can practice getting the angle exactly right, doing finer sharpening. Hopefully that's all you'll need, but if you ever need to do more, once you've got some practice, you can move on to a coarser stone for really reshaping the blade. (Or... you can apparently save money and [use sandpaper](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/16215/can-i-sharpen-a-knife-with-sandpaper?rq=1).)

13,is there a downside to using a wood mortar and pestle?,"I bought a wooden (uhh, stained bamboo?) mortar and pestle today at an asian supermarket. I liked it because it looked nice and it was pretty large, especially for the price. I was also thinking that the larger size would help with peppercorns not flying out of it -- and landing ... somewhere... wait where did that go anyway?


I have to wonder though: are there any downsides to an MP set made of wood? 


",<equipment><mortar-and-pestle>,2011-04-10 22:20:34.257,13942,18,"There are at least three potential downsides:


1. wood is quite light, so you will not get the benefit of added weight of the pestle for crushing;
2. many wooden mortars have a smooth texture, which will not aid in the grinding as much as, *e.g.*, a coarse ceramic mortar; and
3. wood is porous—increasingly so as it dries over time—so it may have the tendency to pick up the flavors of its contents.

4,What is the difference between a wild yeast starter and a sourdough starter?,"Many people only seem to distinguish between 'regular' bread (made with store bought commercial strains of yeast) and sourdough (made with 'wild' yeast). If this is the only distinction - was **all** bread before 1850 sourdough? Is there no naturally occuring non-sourdough type of yeast?


",<baking><bread><yeast><sourdough>,2018-05-28 02:35:33.783,90030,4,"There are many ways to achieve a “pure” strain of yeast or other microorganisms. Modern technology with sterile environments are today’s method of choice, but another is to create an environment that is especially favorable for one kind and allow this to outcompete all others. The principle is not limited to yeast, another important field is cheese making when the raw cheese is aged in an environment with a specific mold - [Roquefort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roquefort) being the classic example. In this case, humans use the already existing colonies in a specific environment or ecological niche.


Even sourdough today works in a similar way, but for sourdough the baker creates a stable mix of yeast(s) and lactobacillae - and by adjusting hydration and temperatures can even regulate acidity and yeast activity.


The earliest bread yeast was a by-product of brewing (hence the name [Saccharomyces cerevisiae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae)). And brewers, especially those that brewed on a large scale like monasteries and commercial brewers, carefully guarded and cultivated their yeast strains that had developed over time. The yeast was and is a huge factor for the flavor of the beer. This lead to the first “just yeast” leaveners. You could still obtain some barm from a hobby brewer and give it a try. Ensure that they are brewing with a top-cropping yeast like S. cervisiae, not a bottom-cropping yeast like S. pastorianus.


The main difference between “wild yeast” and sourdough is ratios: you can use for example raisins soaked in water to get a yeast-rich liquid as opposed to a classic sourdough. Elderflower is also rich in wild yeasts. In short, all plants that ferment easily are suitable sources for wild yeast. I doubt that setting up near a tree will have much of an effect.

6,How to make a sauce using sugared citrus rinds?,"I finally separated the citrus rinds (orange and lemon) from the citrus sugar. All the bits of rind are small. With them I was planning on making a citrus sauce to go on top of my brownies and was wanting help on what flavors would go with citrus rind and how much rind to use? 


I have lots of blueberries and a few raspberries available as well.


EDIT:


I ended up using raspberries, citrus (orange/lemon) rind, cranberries and sugar. It tasted so good on the brownies!

For your specific question of what goes well with citrus rind, you already know chocolate is a good match and that you are putting the sauce on brownies. Nuts in your brownies will be a good match too, especially pecans. Caraway, thyme, cardamom, or black pepper might add an unexpected note with orange. Rosemary is a very nice match for lemon. I recently made cookies using orange zest and black pepper that came out quite well.


If you want the citrus flavor to dominate I would leave out the berries. Otherwise I'd definitely use the raspberries, which go well with citrus. The bluberries would be fine, but I wouldn't consider them your best choice.

1,Efficient method to peel raw potatoes,"I know already how I can peel cooked potatoes, e.g. by throwing into ice water. According to a german helpster entry, the shell will be easily removable just by ""rubbing"". But is there another ""instant"" method for peeling **raw** potatoes? Instant means, I don't want to just peel faster, as suggested [in this question](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/5581/how-to-peel-potatoes). 




---


**EDIT** This German helpster entry I described above mentioned some efficient industry methods - which are unfortunately not very usable in a private sector. E.g. putting the potatoes in a natron solution/leach or putting them into a high steam/pressure environment.


**EDIT2** Sorry for the confusion. I don't want them to boil/cook first; so i want just a raw peeled potato afterwards.

11,Making Beef Stock,"I just purchased some nice beef marrow bones. What I'd like to do is make myself some beef stock for soups and whatever else. Now I'm planning on making a Mirepoix and then adding the bones and then the water. However, my question is this: do I just put the bones in how they are or do I cook them in the oven?


",<beef><stock><bones>,2011-03-07 20:30:59.983,12909,11,"Both methods are acceptable.


A stock made with roasted bones is called a **[brown stock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_stock)**. A stock made from raw bones is a **white stock** (or sometimes just *stock*).


Practically, it's very difficult to get a true ""white"" stock with beef, as opposed to chicken, since all of the impurities will darken or cloud the colour - but that is semantics.


Brown stocks have a richer flavour, but that does not automatically make them better - it depends on what you'll be using it for. For soups, where the stock will give most of the flavour, brown is generally preferred; however, as a ""flavourful liquid"" to use in sauces, risottos, etc., a white stock may be more useful because you don't want it to overwhelm the other flavours.


One cautionary note: Beef bones tend to give off a lot of what looks like blood (actually [myoglobin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myoglobin)) when boiled. If you're trying to achieve a perfect clear stock (white or brown), then you may want to blanch them first; dump them in the pot, bring the water just to a boil, then dump out everything and start over. You really won't lose much; most of the proteins are deeper within the bones and requires several hours of simmering to extract and denature.


If making a brown stock (from roasted bones), do this after roasting, not before. It will also help you to get rid of any excess oil so you won't need to skim as much.

2,I have an insanely hot pepper: now what?,"Someone gave me a Trinidad Scorpion Moruga pepper: according to Wikipedia, it's the hottest one out there. At least, the person who gave me the pepper said it's one of those, and it certainly seems to look like one.


I can take a bit of chili: I've cooked myself meals before with an entire chili pepper in each, and I can take that much without much problem. Having said that, I'm definitely not a pro when it comes to spiciness, so I'm kind of scared to cook with this demon fruit.


What do I do with this pepper? Is there some way I can get the flavor and spice in a meal without upsetting my stomach or searing my mouth (and/or other stuff the morning after)?


*edit: I'm suddenly thinking, maybe I could grind it up and make a big chocolate cake out of it? am I right in assuming the oils in the chocolate will dilute the peppery oil in the pepper?*


",<spicy-hot><chili-peppers>,2013-09-27 20:32:27.083,37162,10,"Have you ever eaten something so hot it made you cry and felt like it'd never stop burning? Given what you've said you've tried, this thing is probably 10-100x as hot as the kind of pepper that would do that to you. Please be careful.


In any case, pretty much the sole point of a pepper like this is to try to be the hottest thing in the world. The amount of capsaicin is incredibly huge compared to the amount of other flavor in it; you're basically never going to taste anything but heat from it. So if you want to actually use it, just assume that the only thing you can do with it is make something hot. 


I have a decent heat tolerance and love things with a bit of heat, but I still probably wouldn't bother. There are plenty of ways to add heat with much less risk of creating something completely inedible. If I really wanted to make use of it, I'd probably start with a very small quantity in a dish to try to get a sense for the heat level. This means using it in some kind of soup/stew/sauce where you can incrementally add things as you cook, not in something like a cake where you have to just go for it and possibly end up throwing away a whole cake. (For some peppers I *might* also try touching it to my tongue first, but I don't think I'd recommend that in this case.) 


Finally, you can always try to cover it up by using it in a rich, fatty dish, e.g. a sauce with plenty of cream or coconut milk, but honestly, you'll still be lucky if you can taste anything from the pepper besides the heat.

7,Could you brine steak?,"I have read that brining pork chops is a good idea but can you brine beef steaks of various cuts? Would this achieve anything good or spectacular or is it just a waste of time?


",<salt><brining>,2019-07-08 10:14:43.540,100044,9,"There certainly are proponents of brining beef to impact texture and flavor. In my looking across the internets, it appears that dry ""brining"" is more common than wet, but both are used for steaks. Whether or not the results are ""spectacular"" is up to you.

Given their leanness, I think a couple of hours in a salt/sugar brine helps. If you like the results, be sure to experiment with time in the brine. As it is possible to over do it, negatively impacting the texture.

* [The Fat Duck Cookbook](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/160819020X) (Heston Blumenthal). Written by the founder of the Fat Duck Restaurant in the UK. It's about the history of the Fat Duck and has a big recipe collection (from the restaurant, obviously) and a section at the end dedicated to food science.

* [Cooking for Geeks](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0596805888) (Jeff Potter) is, as the title implies, written to appeal to geeks, and as such has a certain amount of science but tends to be quite a bit more basic as far as actual cooking technique goes. It's more ""applied science."" Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this for very experienced cooks, but it's great for getting *into* cooking and gaining an enthusiasm for it (if you're kind of a geek).

Even at 135 F, over several hours, the method is safe because the killing of pathogens is a function of *both* time and temperature.


Similarly, the conversion of gelatin to collagen which gives slow cooked pork its unctuous texture is also a function of both time and temperature. While in more traditional cooking methods (oven or barbecue), reaching internal temperatures of about 180 F is necessary to get collagen conversion in a reasonable period of time, it can be done in the truly extended time periods sous-vide cooking makes possible.

That way they'll set much better, as the heated (and thus very soft) sugary components can cool down and firm up. You will find that it's much easier to cut the bars once they've been in the fridge for a while.
It also helps a lot to use a sharp and **wet** knife when cutting. That way you will slide through the bars more easily and the bars won't stick to the blade of the knife.

19,Can you put polystyrene in the microwave oven,"I want to know for sure if you can use polystyrene trays (such as those that meat comes in) in the microwave oven?


I have read some fairly official looking reports and articles that say there's not danger, but there is some anecdotal evidence that they can melt, which while apparently harmless, is not ideal.

Yes, when done under correct instruction. The answer to this question is more complicated than just putting a piece of chicken on a block of packing foams. 


Polystyrene does not contain water molecules, so it does not heat up when microwaved. Any heating of polystyrene in a microwave is due to indirect heating from the food itself ([Source](http://www.dartcontainer.com/web/environ.nsf/pages/health-safety.html#microwaving)).


Polystyrene is a plastic which have melting point of 240°C, however the melting point of polystyrene is largely irrelevant because polystyrene starts to soften around 80-100°C ([Source](http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/chem03/chem03714.htm)). Since most food is composed primarily of water which evaporates at 100°C, and since a microwave oven heats the food directly rather than through ambient temperature, food heated in microwave rarely go above 100°C under normal operating condition. For comparison purpose, the melting point of common plastic categories used in household products: Polyethylene terephthalate/PET 260°C ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate)), Polyethylene/PE 115-135°C ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene)), Polypropylene/PP 130–171°C ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene)), Tupperwa/r/e is made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) is not rated for microwave, but Tupperwa/v/e that is [rated for microwave and is made of polypropylene](http://www.asianproducts.com/product/A12883440403585372_P12892916873103725/tupperwave-microwave-b3-series.html) can be used up to 180°C ([Source](http://www.tupperware.com.au/product-gallery/product-guarantee/use-and-care-for-your-tupperware)). Note that there are a wide variability in the melting point of each plastic categories because many plastics are manufactured with additives to alter their properties to suit their intended usage; when not designed for contact with food, some of these additives may be toxic, so only use food-grade plastics for dealing with food.


As with any usage plastics there are concerns regarding migration of chemicals in the polystyrene to food. The primary one that is often quoted is styrene. One concern is that heated polystyrene may break down to styrene in very high temperature, but this is generally considered a non-issue at the temperature of a microwave. At normal usage temperature, polystyrene do contain a trace amount of styrene due to imperfection in manufacturing processes. However, the level of styrene in polystyrene is comparable to the level of naturally-occurring styrene in many common food items ([Source](http://www.dartcontainer.com/web/environ.nsf/files/M-345.pdf/$FILE/M-345.pdf)). Polystyrene is a polymer of styrene, but they have totally different properties. Polystyrene itself is generally considered to be safe as it is very inert; however, while styrene is not yet classified as carcinogen, it is suspected to be one ([Source](http://www.epa.gov/chemfact/styre-sd.pdf)). ""Epidemiology studies to date do not provide clear evidence that styrene causes cancer"" ([Source](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1273/2013/06/RISK_IN_PERSP_MAY2002.pdf)). At very high level styrene is a neurotoxin ([Source](http://www.ejnet.org/plastics/polystyrene/health.html)), but this is non-issue at the levels found in food containers.


However, polystyrene may not necessarily be the best container to heat up your food for other reasons. While the melting point of polystyrene is only slightly lower than other common plastics, polystyrene starts to soften at around 80-100°C, and handling a floppy cup filled with near-boiling water can be very dangerous. Also since foamed polystyrene is a very poor conductor of heat, you cannot rely on the temperature of the exterior of the cup to sense the temperature of its content.


Microwave-safe polystyrene can be safely used to reheat food in microwave when used according to instructions. Never use polystyrene in conventional oven, and do not use polystyrene to cooking, only reheating. Defrosting meat from polystyrene is most likely of negligible risk, cooking the meat till it's well done is not. Always read the label before using any plastic in microwave. Only use polystyrene plastic that are labelled as microwave safe and never exceed the prescribed operating temperature. Do not reuse single-use containers. If a single-use polystyrene container is rated for microwave use, only use the container for reheating once only. Transfer food to glass or ceramic when you are heating food to the point where a soft polystyrene container can pose burning hazard.


Note, as this is cooking.SE rather than greenpeace.SE, I am excluding discussions that are not directly related to microwave and food, such as environmental/recycling concerns. If you are considering commercial usage of polystyrene materials, you should evaluate these aspect of the issue yourself. There are many cities that ban the use of polystyrene due to primarily environmental concerns rather than safety issues.

0,Making Pickles - Confirming Sanitization Procedure,"I'm about to make a batch of dill pickles. The recipe it pretty straightforward:


* A batch of firm baby cucumbers
* 1 cup of water
* 1 cup of vinegar
* 1 heaping tablespoon of salt
* 4 cloves of garlic, sliced
* 1 pinch of red pepper flakes


The instructions are also pretty straightforward. Sterilize the canning equipment (jars, lids, seals) in boiling water for at least five minutes. Add the washed cucumbers to the jars, boil the water, vinegar, and everything else, and add it to the jar as well. Seal the jars, and then process them in a large pot of boiling water for five minutes. All to cool over 24 hours, and they're good for a year.


Does this sound about right? I don't want them to spoil.


Thank you in advance!

6,Can you refreeze chicken after it has been cooked from frozen,"I buy chicken breasts already frozen from my local supermarket. I want to let them defrost naturally (IE leave the breasts out until thawed at room temperate) and then cook them in a fruit sauce. At this point, I want to refreeze it. 


This will then allow me to defrost the now frozen cooked and flavored meat over night and use them cold in sandwiches the following day.


I can't find anything to advise if this is or isn't safe? 


",<food-safety><chicken><freezing>,2013-07-02 10:33:20.253,35053,7,"The issue here is not the refreezing after cooking, but rather the method of initial thawing.


Thawing methods should ensure that food does not enter and stay in the danger zone (40 F - 140 F, 40 C) for any longer than absolutely necessary, and certainly not for time measured in hours. Doing so risks the growth of pathogens and resultant foodborn illness.


Thawing foods by leaving them out at room temperature—especially, for example, while you go to work—is not a good idea for a couple of reasons. The food on the outside may be too warm before the center is thawed; and if not monitored, there is no way to know when it about to enter unsafe temperatures.


The recommended methods of thawing are:


* In the refrigerator
* As part of the cooking process
* Under flowing cool water
* In the microwave


One or more of these may be appropriate depending on the food item and how it will be prepared.


You should use one of these methods to thaw your chicken.

Assuming that food has been treated safely throughout its lifetime including during thawing, there is no safety reason why it cannot be refrozen. This may reduce *quality* and affect texture, but it is not a safety issue.

4,Selecting [corn] for Pozole?,"I have between 7pm tonight and 5pm tomorrow to make a pozole. Specifically, it will be a red pozole styled chili, using a rubbed and smoked seitan 'meat' to sub for pork. The dish will be vegan.


What are the distinctions between different approaches I can take, and what will result in a better red pozole?


* How should I select corn for the chili?
* Do I have time to do an alkaline-soak and stew until popping the corn?
* Is it just as well that I use hominy?


",<soup><corn><chili><hominy>,2012-01-27 16:46:22.800,20840,2,"Pozole is traditionally made with nixtamalized corn, also known as nixtamal or hominy. So yes, of course you can use hominy - that's what you're supposed to use! Canned hominy/nixtamal is common. I believe that in some areas you can find dried whole nixtamal and possibly even fresh nixtamal - but I'm not sure I ever saw that in Texas, so I'm not sure how much luck you'll have.


As with everything, people say that fresher is better; I can't personally support that, though, not having managed to find it where I live. I have, however, made some pozole that I found to be quite good using canned hominy. Since you're planning on pozole rojo, you'll have a lot of other flavor, which I expect would make the difference between canned and fresh less noticeable.


I suppose if you want to try to nixtamalize your own corn for the sake of having the optimal pozole, you could, and you would have time. I've never tried it myself. From what I've read, cooking/soaking times vary depending on what you're going to do with the nixtamal. For pozole, you don't have to cook and soak the corn as long since it's going to be further cooked in the stew. I've seen varying instructions online. For example, [this site](http://www.pepperfool.com/recipes/tortillas/tortillas_needed.html) says to cook for 15 minutes, soak for another 5-10, while [this one](http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2228-nixtamal-para-pozole-pozole-corn) says to cook for 40-50 minutes. After that you rinse it thoroughly to remove the lime and hulls (softened by the lime), before cooking it in your pozole. I imagine either of those cooking times would produce something satisfactory; with it of course being more tender with the longer time. Note also that the corn won't get that nice puffed shape if you don't remove the tip cap (one of those pages calls it a pedicel - not sure that's the right term).


So with a lot of effort and adventurousness, you could indeed make your own nixtamal (hominy), and it might well be better, but you can also make something extremely good with already-made hominy and not take a risk on something I suspect you're feeding to others.

You can even make it from store-bought cheese, as well as your own cheese.


1. Make or buy a stretchy high-temperature (thermophilic) cheese, such as mozzarella.
2. Heat the cheese in very hot water (traditional method) or the microwave (modern method) until soft, pliable, and stretchy.
3. Pull the cheese out into a long strand, then double it over. Wear gloves, the cheese will be hot.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 as many times as necessary.
5. As the strands start getting thin, twist the cheese into a braid.

6,I lose the flavor of basil when I make pesto sauce,"Okay, I am writing this question as a result of a long experience in trying to make pesto at home :p I like pesto sauce alot and that is why I have decided that I should make this at home. But for some reason when I make the pesto sauce I almost completely lose the flavor of the basil. It tastes more like oil. And yes I have tried varying amounts of oil and basil and still it tastes atmost like oil with grass in it. Here are more details:


1- I stay in UK at the moment so my basils are nearby and they seems to be grown in Wessex if what is written on them is true. When eaten as a leaf they have quite alot of flavor.


2- I have tried using a blender, mortar and pestle and also manual chopping to create the basil paste. After the chopping is complete, I tried tasting the basil paste before mixing it with oil and other ingredients and it tastes like grass more or less, with very little flavor left. I wash the basil leaves before making the pesto as the package itself says so. I use the mediterennian type basil.


3- It tastes slightly better when it is cooked a little bit or left in oil for some weeks but I have seen instances where freshly made uncooked pesto also tastes great, so I must be doing something wrong.


4- I have never grown the basil myself however to increase freshness I have tried buying already grown basil plants in pots. 


Since I have exhausted all possible methods of pesto making it seems to me that either:


a- Since its quite rainy and not so sunny in UK the basil leaves from here have too much water content and to little plant oil content and they need to be dried for some time before being chopped. This might be supported by the observation that when I chop them on wooden board I get quite a lot of wetness marks on the board. And when I use fresh basil from the pot they are usually well watered.


b- UK basil is not good for pesto? 


c- I am somehow mistreating the basil, I should put much less pressure when using a blade or mortar.


Any suggestions is most welcome :)


",<italian-cuisine><ingredient-selection><basil>,2016-08-14 14:15:17.263,73128,4,"I don't have a definite answer, but here are a few thoughts on things that might help.


First, are you drying the basil after washing it? Shake out the extra water, and pat it dry, maybe let it sit for a bit to evaporate. The extra water will dilute the pesto a bit, and not be good for the flavor - and if you think the problem might be too much water *in* the basil, no need to make it worse with extra water on the surface.


Also, are you adding basil stems? Depending on your variety of plant and the steps you take in your recipe, the soft stems or tips might have more flavor that you're loosing by leaving out, or more plant matter to dilute your basil paste if you leave them in. Taste the stems, and check your process, and consider if it would help to take the stems out/leave them in once and see if that helps.


Also, it might help to check your salt content. Some pesto recipes use salt, others use salty cheese, I don't know what your recipe calls for - but salt brings flavors out, and one symptom of under-salting is ""watery"" flavor, so you might just need a bit more. Adding salt might help your basil paste taste like ""basil"" instead of ""grass"".


I was wondering, given your comment on seeing a lot of water on the cutting board from the basil, if you might be losing flavor from the basil juice when cutting. Preparing the basil on the cutting board seems the method most likely to have this problem, but even if using the mortar, if you crush ingredients separately then mix in a different container, you might be losing some of the flavor in juices. On the other hand, most blender recipes (and some mortar and pestle ones) make the pesto in one container, which means the flavor should still be in the mix and not lost- so that might not be the problem, or at least not the only problem.


If the basil is just too mild for your tastes, or has a higher water/flavor oil concentration than you'd like, you might be able to address this by letting the basil dry a little, maybe till wilting, before making pesto to concentrate the flavor a bit. You might also consider adding some dried basil to strengthen the flavor - I would think completely dried basil would not give the right consistency, but a mix of fresh paste and dried flakes might give the flavor profile you're looking for.


If the basil tastes like the basil you expect when you take a leaf and taste, and grass after it's made into paste, then the flavor must lost somewhere along the way - then you can look at your process and guess where the flavor is going (like sap left on the cutting board, or whatever). If you taste the leaf and find it doesn't taste basil-y enough to begin with, then it might just be you prefer a stronger basil or a different variety, and doctoring your basil paste with flakes (or even other herbs/spices) might be the only way to get the pesto you want if no other basil varieties are available to you locally.

**Update.**


1. The sweet turó from cow milk (this one for túró rudi and for túrósgombóc).


* You have to let the milk for 2-3 days in a warm area, to get it slept.
* After that you have to remove the stuff from the top of it.
* Then put the rest to a slow fire and warm it a bit, not too much. (Do not stir it.)
* Then you filter the content from the water with a gauze or something similar.
* Done.


2. Spicy Túró (for túróscsúsza)


For this one you have to get sheep cheese.


* You have to cut the cheese to small cubes (1-2cm).
* Then put it into very salty water for a few hours.
* Then you have to blend it with meat grinder (A blender would make it too small).
* Done.


Hope you will make it very tasty:) Good luck.

They are likely cooked twice: first they are *velveted* (meaning marinated and oil-blanched) and then very quickly stir fried to reheat. In more detail, we have three steps:


1. marinate in a mixture of cornstarch, wine, and egg whites
2. blanch in oil at a very low temperature (at most 300F/150°C)
3. make the rest of the stir fry over high heat, and add the meat at the very end of cooking


Unfortunately, velveting is an involved project. It involves an oil-blanch which leaves you with a lot of waste oil. For home cooking, [some recipes](https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/07/chinese-velveting-101-introduction-water-velveting.html) suggest to replace the oil-blanch with a water blanch.

11,Hot chocolate and cheese (Colombian Special),"I recently visited Colombia in South America and I'm trying to recreate one of their traditional delicacies.


They give you a lovely thick cup of hot chocolate and together with a few slices of cheese. The idea is you break up the cheese and put it into your hot chocolate. The cheese melts partially and you can then eat it with a spoon.


It sounds quite strange, but actually tasted great.


My question is, that I'd like to try to find the same cheese to make it (in the UK). I've heard that mozzarella is the closest, but it doesn't melt in the same way.


The only Colombian cheese I have found is called Queso Compasigna, which means country/rustic cheese). I believe they have another type of cheese, specifically for dipping in hot chocolate. I'd like to know what cheese it is, possible where to buy it or if not how to make it?


Any ideas if its made with cows or goats milk or what sort of manufacturing process it uses?


",<cheese><chocolate>,2013-01-28 12:35:35.067,30476,5,"Queso Blanco just means ""White Cheese"", which is kind of a catch-all term many locals use for simple cheeses. What is meant by Queso Blanco will likely change from region to region even within Columbia, and the chances of you being able to find it in the UK are pretty unlikely. Most imported Spanish cheeses tend to be the high-quality, specialist ones. 


You haven't put what the cheese actually tastes like in your post, so I am assuming it was most likely pretty mild and it is the texture of it that really floated your boat. When I think soft, mild cheese I usually think cows milk, not sheep or goat, although there may be non-cheese alternatives as well in the following list:


* Panir may work for you, it's soft and will get softer, also pretty mild flavor
* Tofu: ok, not cheese but texture-wise a soft tofu may work great, and the flavor will work with chocolate pretty well.
* UK white cheese: any major UK supermarket has a white cheese on sale, usually cheap, usually flavorless. Could be worth a try
* Curd cheese: this is probably what would be called cottage cheese in the US. It's pretty liquid but if you drained it and compacted it you'd get a crumbly, easy-melting cheese


Let us know how you get on, I'm dying of curiosity!

I would also highly recommend you refer to the prime rib narrative of ""[Cooks Illustrated The New Best Recipe Book](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0936184744)"" to learn how to prepare your roast.


[Edit]


Most restaurants that I have either had or seen Prime Rib served at will offer 10 oz or 12 oz serving size, with some variations in the overall 8-16 oz (225g - 450g) range. Appetites will vary from person to person, and you may wish to not serve the 'heals' as they will be more well done than the center, though some guests may prefer this..so, 'your-mileage-may-vary'. The very size of beef ribs makes *serving* them 'bone-in' impractical, as it results in a serving that is too thick for a single serving (though some restaurants do this for eye-appeal). For your home dinner party I would not recommend planning based on 'bone count'. Even if you buy and cook your roast ""bone-in"" your first cut after preparing and resting the meat should be to remove the bones from the roast. Since leftovers are goal you have set for this preparation you may wish to then slice the roast ""on the bias"" (about a 15°-20° angle from perpendicular to the bone section) as it will produce a larger footprint on the plate. The ends will provide you with good meat to include in a soup or slice up for sandwiches.

Of course, when you have a concentrated oil, ""sufficient amounts"" is relatively small. Putting a leaf in some tea is quite different.


There are a number of places on the web selling Eucalyptus tea and giving recipes, but the general recommendation is not to drink too much or make it too strong. The general recommended amount is 1/2 tsp dried leaves or one torn up fresh leaf per cup of water, and 1-3 cups per day.

9,"How can I make cheap, smooth homemade Alfredo sauce?","I've tried making Alfredo sauce several times based on a few online recipes.


It generally comes out pretty tasty, but also with one flaw: the sauce is grainy or gritty because the grated Parmesan cheese doesn't fully melt. Doing searches online, most people seem to recommend starting with block Parmesan cheese and grating or shredding it at home. However, at least at the stores around here, block Parmesan is much more expensive than the usual dried/grated stuff.


Does anyone have a technique for getting the cheaper stuff to melt smoothly into the sauce, or alternatively a cheaper source for the more suitable types of Parmesan?

If you *must* use the Kraft stuff (personally, I think it has no flavour compared to real Reggiano), try melting the cheese on low heat in a very small amount of cream first, before you add it to the main sauce pan. If it's still gritty, either it's curdling or you need to use a better cheese.

6,Why is my meat grinder getting clogged with sinew?,"Last Christmas, I got a meat grinder and I've stared experimenting with sausage making. My previous batches have been around a pound of pork, and I noticed that it seemed to slow down as I went. Today, I pushed through five pounds of chicken thighs and pork fat, which was a huge chore -- almost immediately, it the grinding would slow, and after maybe a half pound, I needed to take the blade out and clean the sinew out of the die. I could then go back and grind maybe a half pound again, before things clogged up.


Is this normal? I can't really imagine it is, or no one would ever grind meat.


I've tried the blade both ways -- one way is definitely the correct way; the other way doesn't cut at all.


I've cut the meat into cubes about the diameter of my thumb -- definitely smaller than the augur spacing.


I know, this isn't the world's best grinder (it's a ""Back to Basics"" brand). Does my blade need sharpening already? Is there some basic meat grinder technique I'm missing? Is the grinder just crap?


",<equipment><grinding><charcuterie>,2012-03-25 00:51:38.200,22601,11,"
> 
> Is this normal?
>

Yes, it is. Sinew and other connective tissues (silverskin/fascia, ligaments) are very tough stuff; you need to remove as much as possible by hand before grinding.


Sinew and ligaments are strong, whitish strands or ""cables"" connecting bones to muscles and to other bones, respectively. They'll be in the same place on every piece of a particular cut of meat: a poultry drumstick has an easily-identifiable piece of sinew -- actually the ""Achilles' tendon"" -- heading from the fleshy part to the exposed end of the bone.


Silverskin is a connective boundary between muscles. It's a thin, clingy, and annoying sheet, translucent silvery white, that you will find on the surface, and defining the divisions of, various cuts of meat. It might make it through the grinder if your blade is nice and sharp and the piece isn't too big, but it's best to take it off (your teeth can't deal with it much better than the grinder can). You'll need a thin, sharp, narrow blade for this: a filet/boning knife, sometimes a good paring kife.


Essentially, anything that's not fat or muscle needs to be taken out before the meat goes into the grinder.


Chicken thighs have a lot of connective tissue. Some of it is hidden inside the muscle segments on the underside of the thigh; make sure you cut those open.


Depending on the particular piece of meat you have, you may end up with what seem like extremely small bits after this process. Even a nice pork shoulder can result in 1/4"" or thinner pieces after the internal connective tissue is removed. This won't have any real effect on the grinding process; the only thing to watch out for is thorough and even mixing if you end up with many different sizes and are marinating/curing the meat before grinding.


You can grind without removing *all* the tissue (it gets frustrating sometimes), but you'll have to be prepared to stop the grinder and clean the blade and plate frequently -- the instant you notice that the meat is not coming out of the plate in clean, cohesive, and separate lines. If you see any signs of smearing or over-grinding (the grind will start to be too fine and become pink as the fat and meat combine), **stop** and clear the blade. Otherwise, the mixture won't emulsify properly, the fat will melt out when you cook it, and the sausage will be dry.



> 
> Does my blade need sharpening already?
> 
> 
> 


It may very well, but this still won't help with sinew and ligaments. 


You should treat your grinder blade the same way you treat your kitchen knives -- maintain its edge, rather than waiting for it to become completely dull. I'd say that I put my blade onto a sharpening stone every 50 lbs. or so. The nice thing is that it's extremely easy -- you are grinding all the arms of the blade at the same angle: flat. The plate also needs to be maintained by grinding the surface where it meets the blade (the edges of the holes should be sharp), but I'd say that this can be done much less freqently. The blade and the plate can both be maintained quite successfully and easily with a piece of fine (800 grit) wet-dry sandpaper slapped on a table.

4,"""Acetone"" smell on bread","I sometimes buy a brand of multi-grain salt-free bread \*. After 2-3 days, it gets a very distinct smell of acetone, like paint stripper or nail polish remover. If I toast the bread, the smell goes away.


The bread is well within its sell-by date, so I don't typically put it into the fridge. This is not a one-off thing - I've noticed it many times for this type of bread.


I am confused by where acetone would come from in the typical grain/yeast mixture used for bread. What could be causing this? Is the bread still safe to eat?

I cannot imagine that the acetone was present when you bought the bread (QA should have caught this if it happens every now and then), so it must be the byproduct of some microorganism chomping down on the bread. Especially if you say that it develops over time. 


On the chance that it is mold (this is more common in bread than bacteria), try keeping it with less humidity. If it is in a plastic bag or in a bread box, stop doing that. Use a paper bag or leave it naked, and not in the direct way of fumes (e.g. a shelf above the stove). 


Seeing that this bread has sprouted grains in it, it could even be moist enough to have bacteria colonizing it. Still, the remedy is the same. Store it in a dry location.

0,How do I know that the quantity of salt is enough for a given amount of flour?,"When making bread during Ramadan, I can't taste the flour. Is there a known ratio of salt to flour when making bread?

If you are always baking for the same people (your immediate family, perhaps) you can find out by trial and error how much they like, or even get them accustomed to a certain amount over time, which will become their preferred amount.

One can also use the sweet-sour (sometimes with the ribs sort of diced with bone attached, fried with a flour dip), and chinese preserved vinegar (This is often an unpleasent flavour for most foreigners who aren't familiar with it IMHO)
2. steaming: You can marinade the rib, either with black bean and chili or sometimes plum-sauce and a little bit of salt to taste. Then just throw it in there and steam it done. The resultant meat is nicely done and we mix the sauce with the rice to make it great tasting (sort of a good idea when i'm out of money and need to eat more rice, and less meat... The sauce is then quite rich in pork fat though, unhealthy, pardon me...)
3. braising: this one is often done with five spice, sometimes red preserved-tofu (nam-yu, as we call it in cantonese).


or you can make your own homemade marinade by using different amount of (1) soy-sauce, (2) salt, (3) pepper (white) and (4) sugar. Then stir-fry it, or saute it, then optionally you can add little bit of starch-water to get the 'sauce' thickened, and serve.

* A self-lighting spark when you push the oven dial
* Some kind of electric indicator light or control system

3,What meats are appropriate for dry-aging,"We know that dry-aging can be used for beef to evaporate water, concentrate flavor and let some of the enzymes break down the connective tissue in the meat, resulting in a tender & juicier steak. 


But why is the dry-aging method not applied to pork, chicken, lamb or fish?


What meets are appropriate for dry-aging and why/why not?


",<dry-aging>,2014-02-27 17:21:55.610,42380,5,"Dry aging creates a certain amount of inherent waste:


* The weight of the cut being aged goes down significantly
* The outer portions become dry, tough, leathery, may have mold, and are otherwise essentially spoiled and must be cut off


For this reason, it is only really practical to dry age fairly large cuts. So this would exclude chicken and most fish, and so on even if their meat would benefit.


Tender meats like chicken and fish don't really require dry aging, however, whose main affect is enzymatic tenderization of the meat. It applies more to red meats, more particularly, beef.


This article at [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/5866754/the-science-of-taste-or-why-dry+aged-meat-is-so-damned-delicious) says:



> 
> When we create [cool and humid] conditions, we allow enzymes to do their work. And we end up with a complexity of flavor—savoriness, sweetness, some bitterness-that just wasn't there before. There's no cooking method that can generate the depth of flavor of a dry-aged piece of meat.
> 
> 
> What happens is that enzymes in the meat's muscle cells begin to break down the meat's proteins, fats, and glycogen—a carbohydrate—into amino acids, fatty acids, and sugars. One amino acid generated by dry-aging—the most important and flavorful one, in fact—is glutamate, which is part of MSG. other amino acids have flavors somewhat similar to MSG; others still are sweet.
> 
>

So you want a meat whose flavor is strong enough to stand up to, and benefit from, these types of changes.


While not mainstream, one can actually locate dry aged pork, although I am not sure it needs the treatment. One can even find dry aged lamb!

2,Why are my doughnuts raw in the middle?,"I recently began making doughnuts. I did a few experiments.


The first time I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfectly. Large, airy, and soft. But on day 2 they were too dry and lost some of their texture.


To address this problem I did 2 half batches as experiments. One I added too much butter and the other I used my sourdough starter instead of yeast.


None of the butter batch cooked properly. All had raw centres. Only 1/4 of the sourdough batch came out right. The rest were also raw in the centre.


I purposely weighed smaller amounts for my test batches. They were 10-15gr lighter than my first batch. They were also less airy. I fried them the same as far as I can tell. 


Why are the smaller doughnuts coming out raw?


",<deep-frying><raw><doughnuts>,2014-06-09 23:12:31.883,44752,3,"The answer is simple: your test batches were less airy, and more dense. The heat from the oil was likely unable to penetrate the dough as effectively and cook the interior.


If the recipe turned out properly the first time around, that's probably not the issue. If your concern is with storing the doughnuts (though how you would have any left is a mystery to me!) then you may want to check out more effective methods of storage. There may be some helpful guidelines in [this thread](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/61/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-storing-bread-in-various-locations).

12,How do I temper an egg?,"I just saw a recipe that said to ""temper"" an egg, which I had never heard of before. I did a little reading on it, but what is the easiest/best way to do it?


",<eggs>,2010-08-04 13:32:01.923,4209,13,"It means, basically, to stir in some warm liquid to prevent it from later curdling. Once the egg is warmed and mixed with some of your sauce, it can safely be incorporated into the rest of the high-temperature sauce without (as much) fear that you're going to end up with scrambled eggs floating around in your hollandaise.


Generally, you crack the egg in a bowl, and spoon in a little sauce, mix it, spoon in a little more, mix it, and then you should be good to go. It goes without saying that if the sauce you spoon in curdles the egg, discard, and start again.

3,can one use a toaster oven to bake cakes and cupcakes?,"I am an amateur chef that has passion in cooking.m looking for a small affordable oven to use for my baking but I am not sure which one to go for. i.e a toaster oven,a microwave oven or a mini oven. please advise.


",<baking><oven>,2016-07-25 05:02:52.070,71653,4,"I don't know what a ""mini oven"" is, so I will skip this one. 


You should not, under any circumstances, get a microwave. A microwave is not suitable for baking. There are models which are supposed to be a microwave and convection oven at once, but I have frequently heard of them not turning off the microwaves when in convection mode, despite the manual saying otherwise. If you happen to get such a model, you will not be able to bake cakes in it. 


I have a toaster oven of this type:

It serves me well for all kinds of cake and bread baking. Whatever has gone wrong with my cakes, I never had the feeling that it was the oven which was the obstacle to them getting better. 


As far as I am aware, you cannot use the tiny toaster ovens which are only about 15 cm deep. I have never tried it, but I would be afraid that the heating elements are too close, and also you cannot fit a cake pan in there.

8,Why does my olive oil smoke/burn when I fry with it?,"I see many chefs/people in food channels who use olive oil to fry stuff (like salmon). However, when I add olive oil for frying it quickly burns releasing dark smoke. Is there a specific type of olive oil that they use for frying that doesn't burn? or am I just possibly doing something wrong?


",<frying><olive-oil>,2012-08-04 14:02:35.450,25470,24,"You're heating the oil past its [smoke point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_point).


There is no trick or technique that will prevent oil from smoking and oxidizing (""burning"") at temperatures above the smoke point. It is literally being slowly destroyed at that temperature.


I honestly don't know why TV chefs are so attached to the idea of cooking with olive oil when most [serious attempts](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/dining/17curious.html?pagewanted=all) to compare it to other oils (for frying purposes) strongly indicate that it loses all or almost all of its unique taste by the end. Some cite dubious health benefits, but the low smoke point of virgin/extra virgin olive oil may also make it *worse* for you health-wise due to exactly what you've witnessed - smoke and oxidation.


EVOO is great as a dressing but it's a terrible choice as a cooking oil. If you absolutely *must* imitate these confused TV chefs, you can either fry at very low temperatures (as in, just barely a sizzle), which will take considerably more time, or used a refined (**not** virgin) olive oil which has a much higher smoke point. These would typically be the ""cheap"" olive oils you find in large plastic or metal containers.

7,What is the difference between kosher salt and unprocessed sea salt?,"I have read that the difference between sea salt and kosher salt is that sea salt is generally processed in that it has minerals added to it which were lossed during the evaporation process while kosher does not.  

Somebody also told me sea salt is inefficient for brining and it contains impurities
I have also read that unprocessed sea salt and kosher salt is the same thing. 


I am using saxa sea salt which on the box says is 100% natural and has no ingredients added. This being the case is it the same as kosher salt or not? 


\*\*


Thank you for your answer. I would like to add a related question. You said sea salt does not stick very well to meat during brining. Does this point apply to dry brining only or does it apply to brining in a water solution where the salt is dissolved?


",<salt><kosher-salt>,2011-12-15 15:35:01.033,19684,11,"Kosher salt is pure, like table salt, but without any iodine and (usually) without any anti-caking agents.


Kosher salt crystals are also coarse, but flat, which makes them easy to dissolve or season/coat meat.


Unprocessed sea salt is simply coarse; the shape of the crystals (whole or ground) does not stick to meat particularly well and the impurities make it harder to dissolve properly in water. It doesn't usually have minerals *added* (unless it's a really cheap kind possibly made from pre-iodized table salt), it just doesn't have minerals *removed* like table salt.


Kosher salt and sea salt are definitely *not* the same thing. Kosher salt can come from seawater, like sea salt, but the ""kosher"" part is all about the size and shape of the crystals, not their source.


Sea salt is not a good idea for brining. It's expensive and inefficient, and by the time the meat is cooked, any distinctness of flavour will have completely disappeared. Some of the minerals may even burn, depending on the cooking method.


Instead, use kosher salt or table salt for brining and add sea salt as a *seasoning* afterward if you want. Using sea salt for cooking, brining, or other preparation is simply wasting it.

1,Texture problem with marinated chicken,"I made a simple chicken marinade from a Nigel Slater recipe the other day: some olive oil, maple syrup, soy sauce, chilli flakes. I marinaded it (1 piece of boneless chicken breast) overnight. When I cooked it, it had tons of flavour but it was too soft. 


How can I marinade a piece of boneless chicken breast so that I get tons of flavour but it isn't too soft?


The piece was frozen and then thawed in hot water. Not sure if that's relevant. 


",<marinade><brining><chicken-breast>,2016-09-07 03:05:15.033,73825,1,"You said thawed in hot water. That is the problem. Thaw in cold water or in the fridge overnight. Using hot starts cooking the meat. I would also suggest searing the meat on both sides and then cooking at 400 until it temps 155, then pull it and let rest for 10 min. The resting will allow the temp to hit 160.

4,How can I salvage burned apple crumble?,"I made apple crumble in small ramekins earlier today. I tasted one and the crumble felt a bit dry and not sweet enough, so I added white sugar on top and put it in the oven on broil, hoping to melt the sugar and make it better.

You may well be able to save the not-so-burnt ones. But you'll have to check the burnt taste hasn't tainted the apple base.


I'd start by carefully removing the burnt bits, (as Dorothy suggested above) and inspecting / tasting the base.


To repair the crumble topping. Mix up a new batch and bake it on it's own. Then when it has cooled enough to handle brake it up and re-top the crumbles.


Rather than grilling/broiling you can get a small blow torch like the ones plumbers use. They are great for this and Creme Brulee. You have much more control.

",<barbecue><ribs>,2010-07-16 19:42:33.307,1208,15,"I rarely ever recommend boiling the heck out of meat. You are washing away all of the flavor. Remember water is a solvent and remove everything from the meat if it is left to boil long enough. For the most tender ribs I would recommend a braise. The slow, low, moist cooking of a braise is perfect for breaking down connective tissue in the ribs without drying them out or washing away natural flavor. Even in smokers I haven't had great luck with baby back ribs as they have a tendency to dry out. 


Here is a easy to follow braise for ribs by Alton Brown [video](http://www.foodnetwork.com/videos/dfn-all-american-roundup/36933.html), [1](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/backyard-baby-back-ribs-recipe/index.html), [2](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/who-loves-ya-baby-back-recipe/index.html).

3,Why Buckwheat Pancakes?,"I'm interested in **buckwheat**. What is it, what are the common uses, and why are there so many recipies (relatively speaking) for buckwheat *pancakes*? What does the buckwheat do to a pancake that makes it particularly well suited for that item?


Does it have certain nutritional or chemical properties that it is valued for in the cooking community?


Is it common among serious/enthusiast chefs, and I'm just out of the loop?


",<flour><pancakes><wheat>,2011-03-28 14:52:44.043,13526,4,"Buckwheat seems to have fallen out of favor in the US. In other countries it is still a staple.


In Russia buckwheat (grechka) is eaten as a hot cereal- just boil it until it bursts and add some sweetened condensed milk. Delicious. In fact- the best way I have purchased it locally is by finding international grocery stores that have a Russian section.


It has a very distinctive nutty, earthy flavor. You would recognize it if you have had it so it seems unlikely to me that there might be some clandestine usage and you are ""out of the loop"" at all.


Although it is very nutritious (a whole grain and all), it is used in pancakes just for the flavor. It's usage in pancakes seems to be purely traditional and taking informal surveys of my friends (in Texas) it is uncommon for anyone to know what it is at all.

5,Rubber like skin on surface of chocolate mousse,"When I make chocolate mousse, I usually end up with a slightly rubbery surface on the mousse.


To make the mousse, I do the following:


* Melt dark chocolate in a bowl over simmering water
* Separate 2 or 3 egg whites from the yolks
* Whip the egg whites
* Mix the yolks in with the chocolate and add a bit of sugar
* Fold the egg whites in with the chocolate mix
* Transfer to bowls and put in the fridge


Usually when I go to eat them the next day, there is a rubber like surface on the mousse, but underneath it's nice and soft.


I am just wondering what causes this, and how to prevent it?


",<chocolate><mousse>,2012-04-08 13:54:11.087,22877,10,"The cause is that the mousse dries out on the surface. It builds a skin of dehydrated mousse. It happens with most cremes, not only your yolk foam. 


To prevent it, put plastic wrap on the mousse. Don't span it over the bowl, press it on the surface itself, without leaving air between the mousse and wrap. Your mousse will stay soft. This also works for custards and starch-thickened puddings. 


In general, also cover other things you put in the fridge, or they can get an unpleasant odour.

16,How long can I store soaked beans before cooking?,"I've soaked some beans in room temperature water overnight, since 6pm (white navy beans). 


How long can I keep them in water before I must use them?

",<storage-method><beans><soaking>,2011-03-21 17:17:55.820,13364,10,"It rather depends on the temperature of the room. Where I live, in the summer it gets hot and humid, and they shouldn't be out on the counter during the day, or they ferment.
In winter (like spring in the northern US, 45-70 farenheit) they can be out for two days with no problem.


My recommendation would be to soak overnight for morning use, or to soak during the day for evening use. It also helps to change the water every few hours, though this isn't critical.
If you refrigerate them with the water, you get an extra half-day. Refrigerating drained gets another day or so.


Either way, they should always be shaded, never in direct sunlight. 


If they do spoil, you'll know, as they'll have a sour/yeasty smell to them.

12,What can I do with a lot of sage?,"We have this sage plant and it's grown into gigantic monster which is consuming my herb patch.


I'm going to attack it with gusto and will have lots of sage to do something with. Last year we made a sage jelly but this year i want to do something else. 


What are my options? 


",<herbs><culinary-uses>,2010-08-19 11:33:55.230,5532,18,"One of the most popular things I've seen sage used for is tea. You just dry the leaves, steep as you would regular tea leaves (personally I like it with ginger root if I have some handy), and then maybe a little honey or lemon. Sage is anti-bacterial, which is a nice bonus.


Meat-wise, I like to use sage with pork chops, either as part of a marinade or just chopped and rubbed onto the pork and then grilled. Sage also goes great with chicken. Roll the sage in your hands to release the oils, then either chop very finely or mash with a mortar and pestle. Mix with a little salt and rub onto chicken breasts, and sautee in oil or butter (or grill it).


Veggie-wise, I think it pairs very well with sliced, sauteed carrots. It goes very well with potatoes, try sweating some onion in a pan with a little oil or butter, adding some potato slices, and right before they're ready add fresh chopped sage. It's also a great ingredient in stuffing, dried or fresh.


I had sage-laced cornbread once, it was pretty delicious. Wasn't there for the making of, so not sure if there was any special preparation needed, but the end result was nice. In fact, a friend of mine a while back who was a baker loved using sage in various breads, but baking is one of my weak spots so I can't really give you any specifics other than ""this combination works, check Google for recipes"" :)


At one point, I heard someone refer to what they called ""sage fritters"", which were basically sage dredged in seasoned flour and egg, then quickly fried in oil. I did a quick search to find the source, and didn't see it, but did come across a very interesting idea: [Sage and Apple Fritters](http://biscuitsandsuch.com/2010/06/11/apple-sage-fritters/) (these are much more of a true fritter than what I first mentioned).


If you get tired of it while it's fresh and you're running around like a lunatic trying to find uses for it, there's always freezing. I freeze or dry any large quantities of herbs at the end of the summer, there are a few methods available. You can reference [this question](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/469/fresh-basil-storage), I feel like there's a better one about specifically freezing herbs on this site but I can't find it right now. The short of it is, some people have good luck freezing whole leaves as they are, some people prefer to chop them or put them in the food processor with some oil or stock, and freeze into cubes. Both methods have advantages and disadvantages.


Alton Brown has a great method for drying described in [this episode (text transcript)](http://www.goodeatsfanpage.com/Season7/Herbs/HerbalPreservation.htm). Essentially, you layer an air filter (like you'd use in your central air unit) with an herb. Place another filter on top, layer it again. Continue as much as you want, then strap them all to a box fan. Instead of weeks to months, you should have dried herbs in a couple days, max. You can [watch the video here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5GkD2GQ3Tg), skip to about 2:30 in. Bonus: the same episode describes his method of freezing herbs, that's about 1:00 in on the same link.


Speaking of Alton Brown, he recommends herb vinegar - you'll find how he makes it on the (text transcript) link in this paragraph.


There are also a TON of medicinal uses and has been used for thousands of years for various remedies. Since this is a cooking site I'm hesitant to list them all (there are a lot), but you can read more about the most popular ones [here](http://www.squidoo.com/sage-herb), [here](http://www.buzzle.com/articles/uses-of-sage-herb.html) and [here](http://www.diet-and-health.net/Naturopathy/Sage.html).


This is non-culinary, but you can use it to ""smudge"", which is often tied to cleansing rites, but can also be considered just a simple incense/potpourri. I had a hippie friend once whose house always smelled like smoldering sage. More details can be found [here](http://healing.about.com/cs/native/a/smudging.htm).

2,How can I tell if homemade ginger syrup has gone bad?,"I made some Ginger syrup using the liquid I boiled the root in for candy. It's just water and sugar. I put it in a plastic liter bottle (from soda water) in the refrigerator. How long can I keep it like that and how can I tell if it's gone bad? It has separated so that there are little bits of ginger in the bottom, but when I shake it, it looks fine. Also, is a mason jar better than the plastic bottle?


",<food-safety><storage-method><storage-lifetime><ginger>,2014-09-27 16:33:43.840,47534,4,"How long this will last depends largely on the ratio of sugar to water in the final syrup. Sugar can inhibit the growth of microbes by reducing the [water activity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_activity#Uses_for_water_activity) of the solution, but this is dependent on the amount of sugar. According to a [book](http://craftcocktailsathome.com/) that I consider quite reliable on these matters, a syrup composed of equal parts sugar and water (by mass, not volume!) will generally keep unspoiled for about 2 weeks. A syrup with 2 parts sugar to 1 part water will keep as long as 3 months. These both assume that you're keeping the syrup refrigerated in an airtight container, which it sounds like you are. Unfortunately, unless you know the exact ratio, it's tough to predict exactly how long this will last.


Discard immediately if you notice any of the following:


* Any visible mold (hopefully this one's obvious)
* A cloudier appearance (harder to judge since you have some suspended particles; you might try running it through a fine-mesh strainer)
* Any gas bubbles or outgassing when you open the container (this is a sign of [fermentation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation))


You might also consider adding a small amount of alcohol. This provides another hurdle to microbial growth, and would extend your syrup's shelf life to somewhere between 3-6 months. I generally add about 1/2 oz of 80-proof (40% ABV) vodka per 8 oz or so of syrup.


Regarding a mason jar, the main advantage these have is that they won't trap flavors the way that plastic can when re-used. A strongly-flavored substance stored in plastic for a time can contribute some of its flavor to the next. Since you're storing a strongly-flavored ginger syrup in a former soda water bottle (which is nearly tasteless) this probably isn't a concern, but if you used the bottle again whatever you put in it might come out tasting subtly of ginger. Glass doesn't have this problem.

8,How to blanch and peel nuts?,"I recently blanched and peeled the ""skin"" off 500g of shelled pistachios and 500g of almonds.


For the pistachios I poured boiling water over them, waited a minute, strained, and then rubbed the nuts in small batches in a clean cloth to pull the skin off.


For the almonds, I tried the same strategy as the pistachios. But this was not so good. The skin starts to dry too quickly. So I poured more lukewarm water over them.


Then I dried them in an oven preheated to 150C for about 10 minutes. They are still a but soft, so I may have to do this again later.

2. Submerge or rinse in **cold** water, to prevent any further cooking and softening;
3. Peel them.


For the case of almonds, you should *not* rub them in order to peel. Just pinch the end - they should pop right out of their peels. If you find it taking *any* more effort than this, stop, don't waste any more time on peeling, and just blanch them again. If you've blanched them long enough, peeling will be very easy.

Ripe apples are generally always firm, even when ripe. Soft apples are generally rotten, except for a few varieties which are primarily meant for cooking into sauce or fillings. This makes it more complicated to tell when they are ripe.


Both apples and pears ripen much more slowly when refrigerated. Most fruit will ripen faster when put in an enclosed space with ripening apples, including other apples.

7,"What exactly is ""vegetable shortening""?","I have not heard about this stuff before.. It is not used in Indian cooking..! 
What exactly is shortening?
I read it in a recipe to bake a rose shaped cake and it uses shortening to grease the pan..


",<shortening>,2013-05-02 11:02:01.213,33903,18,"In baking, the term ""shortening"" alone is used to mean any fat; ""[vegetable shortening](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortening)"" is a fat made from vegetable oil to be solid at room temperature.


Most vegetable oils, such as corn oil, peanut oil, soybean oil and so on are liquid at room temperature because they are unsaturated fats: their fatty acids do not have hydrogen bound to them.


Vegetable oil is converted into vegetable shortening by hydrogenating it, forcing hydrogen to bind on to the ends of the fatty acids. This is done by forcing hydrogen to bubble through the oil under pressure, heat, and in the presence of a catalyst.


![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zg9Nis.jpg) 


Compared to vegetable oil, vegetable shortening is solid at room temperature, white in color, and much less prone to rancidity as it is a saturated fat. It has essentially an unlimited shelf life.




---


It is also very neutral in flavor, so is often used to grease pans. However, any fat will do for that purpose.


In baking, it performs very well in making North American style pie crusts, where it helps promote a flaky crust, but it has little flavor. It also performs very well in deep frying.


As a solid fat, like butter, it can also be creamed with sugar to help leaven baked goods, although it does not give the flavor benefits of butter.


Note that margarine is essentially an emulsion of vegetable shortening (about 80%) and water (about 20%) plus colors and flavorings, meant to imitate butter.

6,Storing knives in knife sheaths,"Currently there is a question about [magnetic stripes vs wood blocks](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/1766/storing-knives-wood-block-or-magnetic-stripe), but I was wondering what the general concensus is regarding knife sheaths (like [this one](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000MDB4UA)) They seem great if you only have a couple knives -- they don't require counter space and aren't at risk of causing accidental harm by falling off a wall. What are the pros and cons of using these instead?


",<storage-method><knives>,2010-09-22 14:51:42.003,7525,4,"I use these and love them. They really do simplify storage since you can just use any drawer. If you ever needed to travel with your knives (I haven't) they are a great benefit there as well. It's also nice to have your knife in one of these if it's just sitting on your counter while you get everything in place. If you're clumsy and you knock this off the counter you'll only end up with a bruise instead of a trip to the hospital.


The only cons I've found are rather insignificant. You have to occasionally clean them, and you have to go through that one extra step to get to your knife.

10,How long does it take botulism spores to germinate in the fridge?,"Based on [this question](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/18632/are-the-claims-legitimate-linking-botulism-to-vacuum-prepared-foods), I started wondering how long I could keep an anerobic food in the fridge before I have to worry about botulism colonization. 1 day? 3 days? 2 months? Clearly it's not a short period of time (hours) or we'd all be dying of botulism poisoning by now. 


Unfortunately, nothing I've been able to find on the net seems to be based on solid studies of germination times. So, if I put a pre-prepared sous vide packet in the fridge, or homemade garlic oil, a low-acid sauce, or lemon curd, or similar, when do I have to toss it to be safe?


",<food-safety><food-preservation><sous-vide><botulism>,2011-10-29 18:33:09.393,18647,13,"This completely depends on all of the *other* factors involved in botulinum growth, not to mention the particular strain you're concerned about (there are several).


Salt, acidity (low pH), low moisture, and extreme temperature (low or high) will all slow botulinum growth significantly.


There are *proteolytic* and *non-proteolytic* types of bacteria. The proteolytic *C.botulinum* bacteria will *never* grow in the refrigerator - they cannot grow at temperatures below 12° C [source](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/10/101003081927.htm). The non-proteolytic strains can grow at temperatures as low as 3° C. That is *very* close to refrigerator temperature so clearly they will grow very slowly - again, the exact speed depends on other factors - but they will grow.


According to [other sources](http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/foodnut/09305.html), the proteolytic strains (the ones that cannot grow in the fridge) are the ones that tend to produce gas and off-odours, so they'll be more easily detectable. They also have far lower heat resistance, so they are easier to cook away. But of course, if they've grown to a sufficient level, it's too late to do that.


As far as I know, there aren't specific guidelines for vacuum-packed foods, whether commercially packed or simply cooked sous-vide. I'd ask you to consider that botulism is not the only type of foodborne illness that can grow in the refrigerator. There's also [listeria](http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm079667.htm), [salmonella](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1968.tb09092.x/abstract), and possibly some others I'm forgetting about. Cooking (especially sous-vide cooking) doesn't kill every last one of them, just enough to make the food safe. By the way, listeria and salmonella are both [facultative anaerobes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facultative_anaerobic_organism) which means that they can grow with *or* without air.


There's also the small matter of your actual refrigerator temperature. Although the theoretical temperature (4° C) is lower than that required for all but the hardiest of bacteria, once you move up even a single degree to 5° C there are *many* more kinds that can start to grow. How cold is your fridge, really? I've heard of some being as high as 10-12° C in parts! If your fridge temperature is even slightly high, botulism will be the least of your worries.


Honestly, given the incredibly tiny number of actual documented cases of botulism ([less than a dozen per year in the U.S.](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/10/9/03-0745_article.htm)) compared to the insanely high total number of food poisoning cases every year ([1 in 4](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29285754/ns/health-food_safety/t/food-poisoning-strikes-americans-year/#.TqxpO977ZMo) according to some sources), people seem to place *far* too much emphasis on that particular species. I realize that it's one of the scariest on account of that whole ""instant death"" thing, but even if you could prove that your improperly-stored food is 100% free of botulism toxin, you could still get seriously ill from eating it. You're literally worrying about the *least* probable vector for food poisoning.


Bottom line, I'd strongly advise you to treat sous-vide food just like any other food in terms of food safety and freeze it if you plan to store it longer than 4-5 days. There are just too many variables at play to conclusively say otherwise.

5,Pork Sirloin vs Chump,"I'm trying to become more proficient in my understanding of pork cuts. I've heard of the ""chump"" (mostly from Brits) and pork sirloin. They both seem to come from roughly the same place on the pig and I've heard their qualities described similarly. Are these two different names for the same piece of meat?


",<pork><cut-of-meat>,2016-05-24 07:35:24.063,69208,3,"Chump and loin are close together but they are very different cuts of meat. Chump is a working cut, so has much more connective tissue than loin, so a slower cooking process is recommended for it. It's not a bad cut at all, in fact it's delicious when prepared properly, you just need to adjust your method when using it. 


One thing to keep in mind is that pork loin has a chump end and a rib end, some people confuse chump end chops with chump, and it's not the same. Chump end chops are still loin, they just come from the back end of the loin and are therefore bigger. 


A sirloin chop is an American term, I don't hear it used in the UK generally. US and UK use different primal cuts. A sirloin pork chop (or steak, same thing) in the US contains several muscle groups. It's got hip, backbone area, a bit of loin, etc. It's a cheaper cut because it's got working meat in it and is tougher. It's a great choice for braising.

10,Cocoa vs chocolate,"OK, this has been bugging me for a long time... According to our cookery teacher at school, chocolate contains three ingredients: cocoa, sugar, and milk. If you mix these together, you can ""make chocolate"".


Back here in the *real world*, this doesn't appear to work at all. And here's why:


* *Chocolate* tastes smooth, sweet, rich and creamy.
* *Cocoa powder*, by itself, tastes sharp, bitter, and repulsive.


You can certainly take a mug of boiling milk and dump cocoa powder into it, and then stir in a little sugar. What you discover is that


1. Cocoa powder does not disolve.
2. The drink tastes *absolutely terrible*.
3. No amount of sugar makes it stop tasting bitter and horrid.
4. Even adding peppermint, vanilla, or similar still fails to mask the awful taste of the cocoa powder.


In short, as far as I can tell, cocoa is *nothing like* chocolate. And yet it's supposedly the most important ingredient...? Clearly something is missing from my understanding here. Can anybody explain?


Probably related: When you buy chocolate-flavoured products, sometimes they taste like chocolate (i.e., delicious), and sometimes they taste like cocoa (i.e., inedible). Why is that?


PS. I'm not trying to actually *make chocolate*. (It's not like it's hard to just *buy* the stuff!) I just want to understand what the difference is.


",<chocolate>,2012-07-19 19:14:35.333,25140,27,"When making chocolate the cocoa beans are fermented, roasted, and crushed/ground. They are then sent through huge presses that separate the cocoa butter from the cocoa powder.


Chocolate is cocoa butter that has been emulsified with varying quantities of powder and usually a ton of sugar and sometimes milk. The rolling of the chocolate with the butter to enhance the texture is called [conching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conche).  

![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/O0Oxh.jpg)


Cocoa powder will dissolve in liquid if you mix it into enough sugar beforehand- this is how chocolate drink mixes are made.


Additionally chocolate is smooth and creamy because of the unique properties of cocoa butter. It can be [tempered](http://chocolatealchemy.com/illustrated-tempering/) to form crystals that are solid at room temperature but melt at body temperature. This makes them smooth and melt in your mouth.


Another reason, besides unwholesome quantities of sugar, why cocoa powder is more harsh tasting than chocolate, is that chocolate has often been [dutch processed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_process_chocolate) where cocoa powder often hasn't.


Cocoa is naturally acidic and harsh tasting. Adding some alkalinity to balance its pH makes it much softer tasting- and darker in color.  

![cocoa powder vs dutch processed cocoa powder](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DE5bm.jpg)  

You can buy dutch processed cocoa powder. Remember that some recipes need to be altered to use it- for example if the recipe called for baking soda you would have to use baking powder instead to maintain the correct pH.

2,What is the correct term for this method of cooking?,"I'm a reluctant cook at the best of times but I'm interested to know what I just did.


I got a *massive* bone for the dog from the butcher. There was quite a lot of meat on it so I thought the dog and I should both have some benefit.


I placed the entire bone (I can't identify what it was anatomically maybe backbone) in my non-stick frying pan with a tiny bit of olive oil. I heated it up to max to brown it and then turned it down to the lowest setting and left it for the whole evening with a Pyrex lid on.


It was thoroughly cooked through and tasted good.


So what did I do? Did I fry it? Roast it? What would you call this?

0,What else can I do with Caputo Blue Pizzeria Flour?,"So I use [Caputo Blue Flour](http://caputoflour.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/00-Pizzeria-SPECS.pdf) to make pizza dough, but out of the 25kg bag I use I only use 24kg per batch.  

I tend to measure a kilo out of the bag and put it aside and then use the rest of the bag to make my dough. However this leaves me with a lot of left over flour, I could use it for pizza dough but that would mean either waiting (and storing) the excess flour until I have 24kg worth, or splitting bags and increasing the complication of making a batch as I'd have to weigh everything.


So instead I'm wondering what else can I use it for?  

I've made bread with it, but only out of excess pizza dough rather than specifically aiming to make bread, and the results are ok but not particularly better than a strong bread flour (though this could be because it is an afterthought).


I've also found (because it is very fine flour) it makes good sauces, and I've used it for Yorkshire pudding and that's quite good too.


I've linked the official fact sheet above, but I think the important properties may be;


* Protein - 12.75%
* Dry Gluten - 12 / 13 %
* Absorption - 55/57


But would it make decent pastry? Or be any good for cakes? Is there anything other than pizza that a flour with these specific qualities would be best for?


",<flour>,2018-11-29 09:53:29.957,94355,6,"*00 flour* is the closest to 'plain white flour' in English speaking countries. For instance, if you were in Italy and would like to do a pastry you would use 00 flour. However, it is quite difficult to compare to 'plain white flour' because this term is not well defined, and you find wide variations in different brands of plain white.


Technically speaking, the classification 00, 0, tipo 1 and tipo 2 refers to the ash level in the flour, as regulated by [italian law](https://www.politicheagricole.it/flex/files/2/f/6/D.34ca305e98ded6c87bfc/DPR_187_2001.pdf). For example, 00 refers to a maximum ash level of 55%, and as you can see from your technical sheet the Caputo exactly fits in that since it is around 50%. If you are familiar, it is completely equivalent to the T45 (45% ash level), T55 (55% ash level), T65 (65% ash level), etc. classification of the French.


While ash level is a good indicator, I personally find that it not always describe well what the flour would be good for. I usually like to use it together with protein content. As you can see, although this Caputo is quite refined (ash level 50%), it has a high protein content (13%) - common for grains grown in sunny places like meridional italy - compared to the most common supermarket 00 I find. It likely absorbs more water and has a better flexibility - which is good for 'caky' and 'bready' things, and even good for elastic pastry like pate brisee but worst for flaky preparations like biscuits.

11,What are these little crystals in my Cheese?,"In some Mature Cheddar, whilst slicing with a knife, I've noticed some tiny crystals.

So, basically there are a variety of salts present in the milk, and formed from milk by the action of bacteria and molds. As the cheese dries, and ripening micro-organisms act on the cheese, these salts fall out of the solution and crystallize. Personally, I love the slight crystalline texture present in aged cheeses, as it almost always comes with a robust and mature flavor.

Making Riccotta and Mozzarella seemed to work out alright, so I decided to try a harder cheese; however, in order to do that I had to press the cheese so that it compressed into the proper form. It was difficult to determine how much weight to put on the curds to get them to form. Too little force and it gets mushy, too much and I felt like I would compress it into a singularity!

If your pan has a non-stick coating that is flaking off... I'd recommend to discard it. The non-stickness is compromised and the non-stick stuff is probably not good to eat. That said, in my experience non-stick coatings are sensitive to scratching from utensils... not so much from the food itself. It certainly depends on the non-stick material: e.g., PTFE, enamel, ... 


Sounds like you're mostly interested in *your* aluminium pan, but also for posterity...


Cast iron requires some ongoing care and feeding. Boiling or cooking certain things in certain ways can cause cast iron pans to lose seasoning. For example, acidic foods or very wet things without fat will tend to degrade the seasoning, leaving you with a pan that's less seasoned and perhaps with some of the ""seasoning"" and/or metallic taste transferred to your food; it might not taste as good, and future cooked food will tend to stick more. For example from Lodge, [recommendations for foods *not* to cook in cast iron](http://www.lodgemfg.com/FAQRetrieve.aspx?ID=14532).

EDIT:


We've come a long distance from the literal meaning of your question. I'll focus on your comment and picture.


It looks like your pan is aluminum, coated with [PTFE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene) (brand name ""Teflon®"") or some similar substance. If I'm correct, your pan is probably very light and heats quickly. It also looks like the pan/coating is badly scratched, and perhaps the coating is peeling off. This means that you're eating small bits of plastic, and the non-stick nature of the pan won't work as well. If it were mine, I'd discard it and never buy anything like it ever again. :) There are plenty of products out there that have more resilient non-stick properties, from well-seasoned cast iron to manufactured coatings.


MORE: 


* As to safety and uses, DuPontTM itself gives answers to [some questions about its brand](http://www2.dupont.com/Teflon/en_US/products/safety/key_questions.html). That says that boiling (e.g., water) in nonstick is not harmful. So, it sounds like you *can* boil things in it. That said, PTFE is actually a rather good [thermal *insulator*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_diffusivity) (~500x worse than aluminium, for example). This seems undesirable for boiling something, when bulk heat transfer is what you seek. It may not make much difference because the coating is so thin, but low thermal diffusion suggests to me that boiling water in a bare metal pan will be more efficient, though a quick search doesn’t seem to be conclusive. Not my choice, but YMMV.
* There are many recommendations of what *not* to do with your non-stick pan, such as [this one](http://thecookingdish.com/0227/the-top-10-rules-when-using-nonstick-pans/). Depending on what you’re boiling there may be a recommendation against it.

2,What effect does removing previously-dried peppers from a sauce have?,"I have a recipe for a basic enchilada sauce, in which I bring tomato sauce and chicken stock to a boil with some spices. It is then simmered for 15 minutes. It calls for using diced dried Chipotle peppers, which worked great - until we bit into one of the pieces of pepper. The heat was a bit too intense for my wife. 


I thought about using big pieces of the dried Chipotle peppers next time, and then picking them out after the simmer. I assume it will take away some of the heat (which is the goal), but will I still get the flavors this way? What other changes could I expect?


",<substitutions><sauce><chili-peppers>,2017-07-07 01:29:08.033,82840,3,"Chilis supply 2 things, chili flavor and heat.

Ordinarily when someone wants to reduce the heat of a pepper I would suggest cutting it open and removing the seeds and membrane, however that's pretty much impossible with a dried pepper. 


My recommendation in this case would be to put the chipotles in whole, then remove them after cooking is done. Put the peppers in after all the other ingredients, just before simmering, then try to avoid stirring it if you can avoid it - be gentle so you don't burst the peppers open. Once the cooking is done you fish them out with a spoon and you can serve them as a side to the heat lovers if you like.

",<substitutions><flavor><candy>,2015-10-02 16:34:04.667,62239,4,"If you want to give something the flavor of almonds, then starting with almonds, in my opinion, is superior to starting with the cousin of almonds. Of course, if your persipan is, in your opinion, indistinguishable from marzipan, then go ahead and use it in good health, but it is likely that it has added flavors to get it to that point (natural or otherwise, depending on manufacturer).


Modern, sweet, cultivated almonds have a stronger almond-y (and in my opinion, better) flavor than apricot kernels and, I would presume, peach kernels (I haven't eaten those). 


Almonds, peaches and apricots are close relatives and the kernels are generally quite similar. Most peach and apricot kernels (as well as bitter almonds) are not edible in their fresh, raw state because they contain cyanide in the form of amygdalin. There are actually some apricots with kernels that are edible without extra processing and in my experience, they aren't as flavorful as almonds, although I guess there could be some varieties with more flavorful kernels, but I think the ones that are being used for the persipan are more likely to be leftover from fruit production and not a specific variety bred for the kernel itself.


When you make marzipan, you just need to grind up blanched almonds. When you make persipan, you need to process the kernels to remove toxic chemicals, which removes much of the bitterness, and then grind them up and probably add in some flavoring. 


I expect it is possible to get the persipan to approximate the flavor of marzipan, and I would expect the texture to be about right to begin with, but personally, I would say that yes, making marzipan from almonds is superior. It's using the variant of that particular nut-bearing tree that was bred throughout the centuries to make the flavor that this food item is most expected to highlight. Marzipan IS almond. ...and sugar, sure, fine, whatever. ;-)

8,Seasoning Chili for Young Children,"We have a 3 year old toddler who is not a fan of spicy foods. She doesn't like heat of any type, and doesn't like strong flavors. How can we season a turkey chili to keep her happy, and still make it tasty for adults?


",<spices><seasoning><chili><children>,2013-01-25 13:51:42.353,30399,10,"You have four immediate options as I see it:


1. Lightly season the chili, remove a portion for your child, then season the rest to your liking
2. Lightly season the chili, then serve it with additional accompaniments to adjust it to your liking (eg, hot sauces)
3. Season the chili to your liking, but serve it with something to help cut the flavor for the child (cheese, sour cream, mix in crumbled cornbread, rice, extra beans, honey or sugar)
4. A blend of 2 & 3.


I generally go with either #2 or #4 if I'm cooking for a large crowd.


... the long term solution is to try to slowly adjust the flavoring of the chili until the child's more accepting of the flavor. But remember, everyone has different tastes, and our taste buds change over time ... the child might be more sensitive to bitter or spicy foods right now, but could learn to enjoy them in the future. (I personally now love spicy foods, when I didn't as a kid ... but I still hate bitter)


You might try making a few varients, and see if there might be a specific taste that your child objects to, so that you can adjust. I assume you have the 'you must try at least one bite' rule, and don't accept the 'I don't like (whatever)' temper-trantrums.

4,What is the difference between sautéing and stir frying?,"I put 1 tablespoon of oil in an iron Kadhai. Then after it gets a bit heated, I put a chopped onion in it, and start moving it with spatula so that it doesn't get burnt and gets cooked evenly.


So, what am I doing, stir frying or Sautéing?


",<language>,2015-10-13 08:10:07.210,62505,5,"It mostly depends on the heat used. If you are cooking at a high enough heat that vegetables and thinly-sliced meats (if using) are cooked through in only a few minutes then it matches with the term generally used as ""[stir-frying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stir_frying)"". In this heat, if you stop stirring even for a moment, pretty much, the food at the hottest part of the pan (at the base, near the flame) will start to burn. It needs to be in motion constantly.


That's the stir part of the stir-fry -- constant motion up the curved sides where it is cooler and letting other parts of the food go to the bottom to the heat and around and around. A full dish of meat, veg, noodles, etc can be completely cooked start to finish in just about 5 minutes. 


[This recipe](http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-stir-fry-vegetables-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-171758) demonstrates stir-frying baby bok choy in 2 1/2 minutes of cooking time for the veg, [this one](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/stir-fried-baby-bok-choy-243124) for 2 minutes, and [an outlier](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/robin-miller/stir-fried-bok-choy-with-ginger-and-garlic-recipe.html) at 3-5 minutes.


[Sautéing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saut%C3%A9ing) should also be at a fairly high heat and generally with less oil (although stir-frying doesn't use a lot of oil either, usually). The heat is lower than what is implied by stir-fry. With sautéing you are still generally keeping things moving, but it doesn't need to be quite as frantic. You can let things stop a moment, and it can help to let them start to brown and caramelize.


To demonstrate, [this recipe](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013418-sauteed-baby-bok-choy) for sautéed baby bok choy cooks them for 7 minutes, [this one](http://www.marthastewart.com/316655/sauteed-bok-choy-and-broccoli) for 9-11 minutes, [this one is another outlier](http://www.chowhound.com/recipes/sauteed-bok-choy-28071) cooking it for 4 minutes. The fastest of these is twice as slow as most of the the stir-fry or about the same as the slowest stir-fry. The slowest of these sauté recipes is nearly 3-5 times as slow as the stir-fry with fairly similar ingredients, especially similar to the slowest of the stir-fry recipes.


But to be fair, [in my comment on the other post](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/62501/how-to-get-rid-of-raw-taste-of-extra-virgin-olive-oil/62502?noredirect=1#comment93433_62502) I was, strictly speaking, abusing the term sautéing by conflating it with even more moderate temperatures (which are more properly simply called ""pan frying"").


A kadai is a good implement to use for stir-frying, but a kadai can also be used for cooking at a slightly lower temperature. Simply using a kadai does not 100% determine the end result will be either a stir-fry or a sauté or a gentle fry, or even deep-frying. It's a versatile vessel. :-)

15,Is pyrex safe to use on a gas burner?,"There seems to be conflicting views on whether a pyrex dish can be used on a gas burner. Can anybody here provide a definitive answer?


",<cookware><stove><gas><glass>,2011-09-24 10:03:48.357,17973,19,"Where do you live? European Pyrex is made from borosilicate glass, the same as in laboratory's equipment; American Pyrex is made from common soda-lime glass. 


If you are in America, don't bother trying it at all; soda-lime glass is sensitive to thermal shock. Even though it's tempered for kitchenware, it is nowhere near good enough for the burner.  

In Europe, you could take your chances if you have a bowl you don't mind risking. However, there is still a significant chance that it will break on the burner some day. While I think that they use the same raw material for both kitchen dishes and laboratory test tubes (which are obviously OK on a gas burner), kitchen stuff is much thicker. This makes it much more likely to break under thermal expansion. 


If you decide to make the experiment with a borosilicate Pyrex, take care to warm it gradually, starting with a small flame, and don't pour cold ingredients into it. Proceed at your own risk. And ask yourself if you really have no pots better suited for the task.

2,Thickening Eggs with Cornstarch,"Recently I stumbled across a recipe that uses corn starch to thicken scrambled eggs and was wondering if there was any advice on tweaking the recipe to try and keep the calorie count down.


3 Large eggs  

1 1/2 tbs whole milk (I use 2%) - 1/2 tbsp per egg  

1 3/4 tsp potato starch or cornstarch (I use cornstarch) -- 5/8 tsp per egg  

3 tbs unsalted butter (I use half that) -- 1 tbs per egg


Not in the recipe but I also add 1/2 tps of garlic when making it 


This ends up being a quick way to make some good eggs but want to make it more healthy if possible.


",<eggs><thickening><cornstarch>,2015-06-14 02:12:16.737,58227,2,"Let's look at the estimated calories in that recipe:


* Eggs: 270
* Milk: 12
* Cornstarch: 15
* Butter: 306


So, given that the single largest source of calories in that recipe is the butter -- more than the eggs! -- if you're looking to reduce calorie count cutting back on the butter to 1 Tbs is the way to go. Of course, that will affect the flavor as well. The cornstarch isn't significant in those quantities.


(calorie counts are via Google, but are consistent with what I've seen elsewhere)


My personal perspective is: if you're looking to reduce calories, simply eat less. Compromising flavor in order to save calories is pointless; just make delicious foods in very small quantities.

6,Making Medium-hot Mexican Sauces,"Thanks to the book *Truly Mexican*, I've recently gotten into making cooked Mexican sauces like Adobos, Moles and Pipians. However, my sweetie is unable to tolerate anything above a mild zing in hot pepper flavor. 


I've found it very difficult to calibrate the recipes to make them have a little bit of hotness, but not so much that she can't eat them. The other night I made a green pipian, and removed the seeds from the jalopenos to make them less hot ... but succeeded in removing all hot pepper flavor from the recipe entirely. Then I made an adobo which seemed OK until it sat for an hour, but then became too spicy for her to eat.


Tasting the peppers or the paste while it's still raw isn't very effective because peppers often get milder or hotter during cooking.


Does anyone have tips, ratios, or tricks they use to make cooked Mexican sauces which have zing but are not too spicy? 


",<sauce><mexican-cuisine><chili-peppers><spicy-hot>,2012-03-05 01:41:05.330,22061,6,"**Tasting** the peppers is absolutely the only way, short of a chromatography machine. This is especially true for jalapeños from grocery. This because, as stated on this site here and in other answers by myself and others, pepper spiciness can vary greatly even on the same plant. Accordingly, chiles mixed possibly from plants, even from different harvests or suppliers, cannot be expected to have any reliable consistency of spiciness.


My approach is to pre-dice and [freeze](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/18026/can-you-freeze-jalapenos) in batches. I use baggies, but another approach mentioned on this site [here](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/8165/how-to-use-spare-jalapenos).


**NOTE:** The applicable advantage to this approach is that if you cook using the chiles often enough to warrant this approach, the heat level will be more consistent batch-to-batch.




---


My preservation process goes something like this:


* Purchase many fresh chiles at once depending on what you will use in 3-6 months. (I use 25 to 50)
* Sample the heat of each pepper during the preservation process
* Dice the peppers (de-seed beforehand if desired)
* Segregate into three groups:
	+ Mild / non-spicy
	+ Killer-blazing hot
	+ Normal (everything in-between)
* Freeze into single-use sized baggies (~1¢ each, non-zip)
	+ Place the smaller baggies into a larger gallon-sized zip-type freezer bag (~15¢ each) labeled with the spice level of pepper type, date processed, and heat level the contents.


Though I always keep seeds because I want the spice, this approach can be used with or without a de-seeding stage in the process. Another perhaps applicable note is that IME, without seeds, jalapeños spiciness falls within a narrowed range.


To reiterate in summary, one advantage here beyond preservation and availability is that as you have the three piles of diced chiles, the spice heat level of each batch segment tends to be nicely consistent.

11,What's the point of long/complex sourdough feeding techniques?,"About a year ago, a friend taught me how she makes her sourdough bread and gave me a portion of her starter. It works great and makes fantastic loaves. I've started to look at other recipes online and in various books (e.g. Flour, Water, Salt) to better understand how different types of sourdough breads are made and I've realized that the splitting/feeding of the starter in my recipe is quite a radical departure from every other Levain/sourdough-starter recipe I've found. Otherwise, it seems to be the standard high-hydration (78%-80%), autolyse (2 hr), bake-in-a-dutch-oven approach that's so common these days.


Specifics:


* I typically only have time to bake once a week, so I store my
sourdough culture in a glass jar in the fridge.
* For most of the past year, when preparing my dough I would simply  

take the starter out of the fridge, split it, and dissolve both  

portions directly in warm water (~90 F).
* The starter would then get some flour and be put back in the fridge  

(100g starter, 100g water, 100g flour).
* The portion for the bread would simply have the flour and salt added,
autolyzed with occasional folding, divided and allowed to rise  

overnight (~12 hours).


In contrast to this simple approach of dissolving the starter directly in water and then adding the flour for autolysing, every other recipe I've found seems to require a 12 or 24 hour pre-feeding routine that involves feeding the starter first, then discarding most of this newly fed starter before adding this ""revived"" starter to the water/flour before either a long bulk fermentation or a long rise time. Or some even require multiple feedings...


Why do people spend so much time and energy on long drawn out pre-feeding routines? My approach obviously works - the bread rises just fine, the crumb is fantastic (that's mostly due to autolyse and cooking in a dutch oven), it develops a nice flavor and a little sourness over the 12 hour rise time (especially if it's a cold night). 


What am I missing? Better flavor? I can seen an argument for getting the culture more active this way, but I don't see much difference between that and simply allowing my culture to warm up to room temperature. In fact, I've started letting my culture warm up before splitting it this past month, as well as leaving the newly fed cut at room temperature for several hours before sticking it back in the fridge - however, I haven't noticed any difference in flavor nor in how long it takes to rise, etc.


",<bread><sourdough><sourdough-starter>,2018-04-04 21:24:18.473,88940,12,"Absent a definitive answer here, I'm going to take a stab at this based on some experience I had with difficult sourdough starters. Note that I make a lot of sourdough items but do not do any kind of multi-stage prefeeding ritual.


Sourdough is a culture of multiple types of bacteria and wild yeast. Sometimes wild yeasts do not reproduce rapidly or produce as much carbon dioxide (for leavening) as commercial yeasts. I've definitely had the problem before with a starter that it wouldn't produce anything other than a superdense bread, no matter how long the dough rise.


Most of us keep our starters in the fridge (unless we run commercial bakeries). Thing is, at fridge temperatures, the bacterial culture will grow, albeit slowly, but the [yeast will hardly reproduce at all](http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/2001-01/980908832.Gb.r.html), and will produce no carbon dioxide. So, when you take it out of the fridge, if you use the culture immediately you may have an imbalance of active bacteria but sleepy yeast (this is some inexpert armchair biology here, so a big pinch of kosher salt with it).


You are solving this via the use of 90F water. I solve it by proofing a sponge for 7-12 hours. However, there are clearly sourdough aficionados who feel that this is not sufficient to restore the yeast to full strength and that it needs more time and feeding. The feed, split, and discard routine I believe comes from commercial bakeries that never refrigerate their starters because they use it every day; it is the advice given in the [Berkeley Cheese Board's cookbook](http://www.powells.com/book/-9781580084192), for example. Doing this over 36 hours or so could be assumed to get the sourdough into the same state it would have been for a sourdough kept constantly at room temperature and rotated every 24 hours, allowing you to use the exact same rising times/temps as they would use.


Now, back to my all-natural wild yeast starter that wouldn't rise very well. I did not try feed-and-split for 36 hours; maybe that would have made it rise adequately and is the reason for this technique. Instead, I started the starter-making process over and got a better strain of yeast the second time.

12,How to make cappuccino coffee at home without a machine,"I do not have any form of a coffee machine. The closest is a kettle… I have tried to use strong/good quality instant coffee, filling half a cup then hot boiled milk in the other half. It just tasted like coffee.


So how do I make a cappuccino at home without all the fancy tools?


",<coffee><foam>,2016-03-18 06:37:58.517,67536,14,"Do you have a French press? If so, you can make coffee that is quite strong in there and you can froth your milk. 


For the coffee, grind it course. If it's too fine, too much will go through the mesh and your coffee will be murky and over extracted. Buy a very dark roast, but something that isn't too smoky. Italian roast is too smoky. Espresso beans typically have more of a caramelized flavor vs. smoky. 


For the milk, warm it a little more than you want for your cappuccino. Put it in the clean press. Vigorously pump the plunger up and down. This will make luscious, dense foam. If there are too many large bubbles pump longer, or you can stir it a little. 


I don't love specialized or expensive equipment either. French presses are inexpensive and useful for steeping many things. They are also small, and you can use them when you are away from electricity (camping/zombie apocalypse/etc).

4,What to do with ginger leftover from ginger ale production,"so I have been experimenting in ginger ale brewing lately and I have been following a method which involves fermenting the ale as always (ginger, water, sugar) and then discard the ginger before bottling.


But as a good ginger lover, I found it to be a pity to discard that much ginger for every batch I make. So, is there any usage for those leftovers? Maybe some kind of candy?


Thanks


",<ginger>,2017-09-22 19:24:20.730,84633,7,"I have used excess ginger by candying it- I boil it for about twenty minutes in a simple syrup, when I take the ginger out of the syrup I place it on a cooling grate and let it cool completely. I then roll each individual piece in turbinado sugar(I have used white sugar too.) To store I place it in a plastic bag with a little extra sugar to prevent the pieces from sticking to each other. I also keep the syrup tightly sealed in the freezer, the syrup is great for cocktails, or as a remedy for an upset stomach. 
I have also peeled leftover ginger and stored it in a tightly sealed container inside my freezer. This is convienent because when you need ginger, you can easily grate the frozen ginger for your recipe. Generally you can store it frozen for at least a good three months. Hope this helps.

Last summer I made 16 pints with this recipe, and it was basically inedible due to the overwhelming vinegar bitterness. We ran this back by her boss who gave us the recipe, and she said she really just wings it on the vinegar.


So my question is, for this recipe how much white vinegar should actually be used? We have our garden veggies ready for salsa making this weekend, and I really don't want to waste all of them again this year! Hope I can get some help on the vinegar part!


",<vegetables><tomatoes><vinegar><salsa>,2017-08-04 13:23:08.407,83502,20,"The guideline for the safe canning of tomatoes is for 2 tbsp of 5% vinegar per pint of tomatoes. If you made 16 pints then you'd need 32 tbsp of vinegar, and that is almost 2.5 cups. This isn't to prevent spoiling, the processing will do that, it's to prevent the growth of botulism, which boiling does not do. 


However, the recipe above calls for 16 cups of tomatoes, 4 cups of onions and 2 cups of jalapenos, for a total of 22 cups of vegetables. That's 11 pints, not 16, so if you added 2.5 cups to that you've gone almost 50% over the amount you need, which could account for the strong acid flavor. For that volume 22 tbsp or 1.65 cups would be sufficient. 


It's possible your wife's boss is adding vinegar until it tastes good, then canning the result. This isn't safe because it means there could be far less acidity than would be wise (I'm assuming that the boss is using a water bath method because that's what the recipe says, if she's using a pressure canner then it's a different story). If this is the case then this recipe will never really work as is because to make it taste right you'll have to compromise on food safety. 


You have a couple of options here: 


* Buy a pressure canner: you can probably ebay one for not much money, and it means you can get the flavor you want. Processing time is much shorter as well, giving you superior product (the guidelines for a water bath are 40-50 minutes, in a pressure canner it's just over 10)
* Try a different acid: citric acid powder adds acidity without much flavor. The guideline is 1/4 tsp per pint. Canning supply shops will carry it, it's easy to find on the internet. Lemon juice (commercially bottled for consistency) is also a favorite for salsas, 1 tbsp per pint is the guideline.


If you decide to change acids or acid levels then I suggest you do a small test batch to make sure it's good before going full scale.

Since it still is not lacking for sweetness, at all, I began pondering whether I could make this using crabapples. I have zero experience with crabapples, except maybe biting into them and spitting them out as a small child, back when parents let their kids roam the neighborhoods like packs of feral dogs.


Are crabapples considered to be edible, but not especially delicious, or are they considered to be, generally, not edible (or even are dangerous to eat)?


",<fruit><dessert>,2017-10-19 21:09:12.123,85114,3,"Some crabs are better tasting than others. Ornamental crabs, to my knowledge none are inedible, but tend to be very small, and high skin/seed to flesh so tend to be too much trouble to bother with. Larger crabs though can be very desirable for some applications. They are often blended in mixed ciders, both sweet and fermented. They will be tart to very tart and even bitter, but when blended with other juices add what many people consider a very refreshing bite to the juice. Candied crabs and apple butter are commonly made with them and they can be used for jams other applications especially mixed with other apples to increase tartness.


There are a wide variations of varieties, just as with full size apples, and some will seem better than other. If they are wild seedling trees rather than grafter varieties, the quality of the fruit may be hit and miss, and even some of the cultivated named varieties may be astringent, especially some which are marketed for their hard cider characteristics where the astringency is desirable. If the particular ones you have will work will be mostly dependent on your tastes and the variety, and how willing you are to work with the smaller fruit. Even the sweetest crabs are likely to have a lot more tartness than a granny smith.

14,What is the best way to store fruit in bulk to make smoothies?,"Next year for university I'm moving into a new house with a large chest freezer (a big upgrade from my current freezer drawer). I've always been a fan of making fruit smoothies with banana, milk, yoghurts, berries and what not however the biggest problem with this is that since I've moved out I can't afford to keep buying fruit for it to go off. So I have essentially 2 questions 


Firstly is it realistic to buy fruit from the market where its cheapest, I'm thinking all fruits from apples to bananas and from berries to mangoes and then just throw them straight in the freezer, will this preserve them ?? Then the next day get them out and throw them straight into a smoothie.


Secondly and more preferably would I be able to buy a lot of fruit make it all into smoothies then put these into containers and freeze them, then get them out the night before so they will defrost and I can drink them for breakfast in the morning.


Thanks in advance 


",<fruit>,2014-12-18 15:00:34.393,51725,13,"In professional smoothie/frozen youghurt/fruit shake shops, you'll usually see the fruit frozen in small pieces for easy portioning.
So raspberrys and blueberrys are fine, but you'd wnat to quarter strawberrys and cube mangoes or apples or kiwis or whatever before freezing them.


The freezing process itself is important to the strucutral integrity of the fruit, and will affect its texture. However, if you only want them for smoothies/blended drinks, that isn't very important.


As a usage note, remember that a home freezer compartment is usually at -4 degrees Celsius, whereas a chest freezer (deep freeze) would more commonly be at -18 degrees. A good blender won't mind either way, but your lips might find it a bit cold.


Also, you might find you can buy the fruit pre-frozen from the same vendors the shops get them, in which case it will be prepared for you, and all you need is to defrost and blend. Aside from saving you the work of peeling and chopping, their freezing process may be better, and it'll probably end up being cheaper too.

4,Salt 'n pizza (how much salt should be in the dough),"I've made a pizza today and thought the dough could use a little more salt. I've looked at [this answer](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/21530/641) and have a question about the salt ratio. How is it calculated? The percentage of flour, or the percentage of dough?


My pizza recipe calls for 300 g flour, 150 ml water and 3 g salt. That is 1% of the flour weight, but less of the total weight. If 3% is the recommended salt level for bread, I should be using 9 gr for the flour, or 13,5 g for total weight. That is a huge difference.


**Edit:** The recipe calls for 1 tablespoon of salt, 1 bag of dry yeast (but I use my own mother dough), and 60 ml oil.


**Edit:** I believe I measured one tablespoon to be 3g :-(


",<dough><pizza>,2012-03-19 13:18:00.227,22387,5,"When you have a (good) bread recipe, the weight ratio is always given as percentage of the flour. This tradition is known as a baker's percentage.

So, if you recipe calls for 300 g flour and 3% salt, it needs 9g salt. The water at 150 ml is 50% - a rather low hydration, don't do this with bread flour unless you have another liquid in the recipe you didn't mention (eggs, oil, or additional water for a poolish). It will be stiff with AP flour, but I like it that way, while other people find it too hard. It is up to personal preference, I guess. Also measure the other ingredients (yeast) as a percentage of the flour weight. And if you are given a recipe for fresh yeast, don't forget to convert it to instant dry if you are using it, or vice versa - the conversion factor is 3:1.

7,How can I improve my gluten-free pizza dough?,"I've been making pizza dough for years, and recently found that I have a gluten allergy, and can no longer eat wheat flour! Very sad news, indeed.


So... I bought Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Pizza dough mix, which has a bit of xantham gum in it, and serval kinds of flour (rice flour, tapioca, flour, corn flour, etc). The dough itself was difficult to work with, a bit crumbly, and not as stretchy as I would like. I know that the ""stretch"" I'm talking about truly come from gluten, but is there anything I can add, to help with the consistency? The flavor was perfect, and the calzones were wonderful, they were just really hard to form...

3,How to thoroughly bread meat with eggs and flour for frying without the mess,"When making dishes like Chicken Parmesan, fried zucchini, general tso's, etc, and prepare the breaded item, I first scramble a few eggs then dip the the item from there into either flour or breadcrumbs then straight to the pan.


Flour is the worst, as the egg can get into the flour and create a cement like mixture that's very difficult to clean from your hands. Breadcrumbs aren't as bad mess wise, but can still be an issue when the goal is a clean, even coating all the way around. 


So my question is what is the best process to use when preparing fried foods like these in an assembly line-like fashion, without the huge mess and splotchy coating, or are my ingredients themselves to blame?


",<eggs><frying><flour>,2013-01-15 18:18:01.373,30127,5,"I personally like to use forks when I'm breading, so that I don't have to keep reaching into the containers. I use a pair of forks in each containers, which I use to move the food around 'til it's coated, and then lift them to drop into the next container (important -- the forks should *not* go into the next container ... grab from one end, lower in, but release before the forks touch the stuff in the next one).


You can also use chopsticks or tongs, but I prefer the forks as I can use them to scoop up a bit of flour or breadcrumbs to sprinkle on the bare spots of whatever I'm breading.


Other tips:


* Prep all of whatever you're going to be breading first (assuming you're cooking alone, and don't have a helper). Having to wash up because your hand's all chicken-y really slows you down.1
* Never go backwards. Yes, some people like to go back into the flour, but if you're looking to be mess-free, don't do it.
* Shake off items before going into the next container ... you want a minimal coating of everything -- flour won't stick to flour, so shake off the loose flour before going into the egg. Let the egg wash drip for second or two before going into the crumbs, and shake off the loose crumbs before going into the pan. This will both create a crust that won't separate from the food as easily, but also prevents that growing cluster of crumbs forming in the third container.2


If you're looking to do some breading with the kids, and the kids are too messy, the crumb and flour can be placed into paper bags, and you drop items in, seal up the bag (fold over + binder clips), and then let the kids shake the bag. You might also be able to use containers with a tight-fitting lid. It'll slow you down overall, but it's no worse than the constant 'I want to help' pestering.3




---


1 You'd note that I said ""hand"" and not ""hands."" I keep a strict rule that whenever possible, I only touch raw chicken with my left hand, so that my knife hand never gets slippery (and so I can grab the phone if need be without washing up).


2 Some people also disagree with this step, as in the case of fried chicken, you don't get those extra crunchy bits on the outside. There is, however, a solution ... take the fork in the egg wash, and let it drip into the crumbs, then use the crumb fork to coat them, and lift them to the top of the container ... then set the item to be breaded on top of them as it comes out of the egg wash. 


3 Before you worry about me suggesting that I have kids and I consider them pests, no, I don't, but I frequently cook at a friend's house and they do, so we have to set up the breading station away from the stove so that they can help (at home, the crumbs would be right next to the hot pan). Although some people put the crusted objects on a tray or wire rack and let the eggwash dry for a few minutes to reduce crust separation.

8,Jiaozi potstickers sticking to fry pan,"I've been having a problem lately with my potstickers sticking to my pan too much. This didn't start happening until recently. 


I'm using my stainless fry pan rather than a nonstick. Mostly, because I like this pan the most. But perhaps I'm just using the wrong tool for the job.


I've tried to let them cook longer after the water has evaporated even until some of the bottoms burned as an experiment. even then some still stuck.


Here is my current method.


1. Get pan hot over medium high heat.
2. Add a couple tablespoons of olive oil. I've tried more and less with little change.
3. Let oil heat to ripple.
4. Add potstickers.
5. Add .5 to .75 cups of water.

Use the ""[water test](http://rouxbe.com/cooking-school/lessons/173-the-water-test-heating-the-pan)"" to know when the pan is hot enough to add oil. Besides being fascinating to watch, passing the water test ensures the pan becomes amazingly non-stick.


When the pan is hot enough, water will ball up like mercury and slide around the pan without evaporating. The temperature required is pretty high, but I've found the non-stick properties remain if I add the oil and let the pan cool to the cooking temperature I want.


Note: preheating the pan like this applies to non-stainless steel pans, but water only balls up like mercury on stainless steel.

23,What's the best way to store rice long-term?,"I have purchased a rather large bag of long-grain white rice (25 lbs.) and need to know the best way for storing it long-term. This rice will be used as both a food-storage food source and as my everyday source of rice for cooking, so the storage solution should (hopefully) be resealable, rather than once-it's-open-it's-open. I eat rice maybe three times a month, so it isn't really ""everyday"" but it will be my go-to when I have it.


",<storage-method><rice>,2011-06-28 22:08:35.893,15842,19,"If you are only using it three times a month then this 25lbs bag may last a very long time indeed.


The problem is that even white rice can eventually develop off flavors when exposed to light and air. Additionally- even if pests don't have access to the rice, it is not unlikely that the rice has some eggs on it that can hatch and spoil the whole bag.


The solutions to these problems all make it difficult to use the rice in the short term. For long-term food storage dry foods are typically sealed in either #10 cans or mylar bags. An oxygen absorbing packet is also included. This will prevent spoilage and pest growth. Mylar bags are less expensive and you can open one bag at a time for short term use.


Alternatively- if you can freeze the rice to ensure there are no pests then the rice can be stored, sealed, in a cool, dry place as others have described.


Given how cheap rice is- it might be acceptable to you to just take your chances and replace it if it spoils after some months.

* [grapeseed oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape_seed_oil) or any cold-pressed natural oil (pumpkin, flaxseed, cannabis, ...)

### Why?


Pureed avocados contain [about 18% oil](http://www.avocadosource.com/Journals/SAAGA/SAAGA_2014/SAAGA_2014_37_PG_62.pdf) with the rest being moisture and solids, so a mixture without any butter:


* aligning with the goal of the current ingredients
* enhancing the taste of the cocoa powder
* having the same kind of *texture* in the final product,


leads me to believe that above mix can come extremely close to what you're trying to accomplish.


### How?


Cocoa butter is a *solid* at room temperature, so you'll have to heat the cocoa butter to body temperature (the melting point being in between 34–38 °C), so I would start off with 30% melted cocoa butter and 70% grapeseed oil (at the same T°) and use that.


If your dessert becomes too solid, replace 10% of the cocoa butter with grapeseed oil and if the reverse, replace 10% more grapeseed oil by cocoa butter and keep refining your recipe until it's *just perfect for you*.

The end of June is generally not going to be warm enough, however you might get lucky as sometimes its early, and it's worth asking because they are the most amazing tasting lobsters you will ever try.

A lobster pound is the place where independent boats bring their lobsters to and sell, from there they go out to restaurants across the world (although some local restaurants will have their own docks and boats). Many pounds are set up as restaurants or cook lobsters and steamers (local clams) to order as take-out. It's the freshest lobster you'll get and the best prices too. Just call them up and ask if they have any shedders and they'll tell you, most will take orders over the phone although you can go to them as well. I hope you find some, there's nothing like them anywhere.

",<baking><cake>,2012-03-11 11:45:30.837,22187,8,"Yes, it makes a difference. In a conventional oven (even one with a convectiono fan), anything placed on the bottom rack is going to absorb less radiation heat from the oven element. That means longer cooking times and possibly the need for a higher temperature setting.


If you're following a recipe then it's best to use whichever rack the recipe says. If the recipe doesn't specify, it's usually designed for the center rack.


Now, using a different rack is *completely* different from actually baking one thing *on top of* another thing, on a higher rack. That will have a *significant* effect on whatever is underneath, and if it is particularly sensitive to the time and temperature (many baked goods are) then it is very likely to fail entirely. I once tried to bake two layers of cream puffs and the ones on the bottom were still practically raw by the time the top was done. I doubt you'd find much better success with cakes.


A convection fan *may* help in this case, but I still don't think it's enough to compensate for the temperature gradient you'd create by ""eclipsing"" one dish underneath another in the same oven. You are literally blocking the heat from reaching the bottom dish.

Oils can bind to glutenin and gliadin and inhibit these reactions, so fats--oils and butter--definitely play a role in the texture control.


It prevents the dough from getting too elastic, which controls texture. This elasticity change would also change the maximum air bubble size. Altering resting times and yeast quantity also change these, but trading off for a different flavor. Oil may play other roles, but these are what I recall reading about off the top of my head. Yes, it does contribute to flavor as well.

Whoa. Whoa. Whoa....thats not cheesecake, thats no-bake 'cheesecake'. And that's not normal sugar, that's *icing* sugar.


No bake 'cheesecake' is *much* more forgiving about the ingredients - you'd not trying to set a custard like, you just want a thick, flavored, semi-firm pie filling. Add the honey, but leave off a touch of the creme, maybe 20-30 g overall? Icing sugar will actually thicken it a bit as its not only *not* a liquid, but its also got cornstarch in it. There's about 1/4 tsp of cornstarch in that much icing sugar, so I'd add that. If you're against cornstarch, I don't think it'd be the end of the world to leave it off.


I'd add the honey and then add 350 g of creme and see how the consistency is. You'll probably end up adding another 20g or so, but I'd wait and see.

The refrigerator slows down the yeast without killing it, which also increases the flavor of the bread (over night cool low yeast methods for bread are considered the ""right"" way to make bread). 


In the morning, pull out the bread, press out any large bubbles, roll it around and let it come to life again. I usually punch it down one more time and then let it rise in the pan or on a sheet depending on what kind of bread I am making, then bake as normal.


In your case, because you're doing a stuffed loaf, assuming there is a rise before the stuffing, THAT is the point where you will start the morning.

I tried both on medium and maximum flame. I am now doing it on a propane-butane portable stove in a van, but the maximum flame on the stove doesn't differ visually in size from a maximum flame in a brick-house stove. When I was doing them some years ago it was in a brick house on methane gas.


I do it on a simple thin Teflon-coated pancake pan.


I also don't use any eggs, and I am trying different mixtures of flour, usually about 85% of wheat flour, and the rest either: corn flour, rice flour or powdered milk. And 900 ml water per 400 grams flour mixture. 


But even when I tried making them once with 900 ml milk plus 400 grams wheat flour, they also took a long time to make. 


Is it because of the lack of eggs, the heat is too low, the pan is bad or something else?

7,Why didn't my turkey stock gelatinize?,"We made turkey stock of out our Thanksgiving scraps. We simmered the turkey bones (unroasted) and all the vegetable trimmings for about 7 hours, and then chilled everything and stashed it in the refrigerator overnight. 


But the chilled stock doesn't have any jelly-like thickness to it. It's pretty much a tan-colored liquid.

I make stock for a single turkey with the wing tips (not the 'drumstick' part), the back, the neck--everything but the breast and leg/thighs in with about 1 gallon of water to start, which reduces to several quarts over the course of three-four hours.


This produces a very shaky jelly--much thinner than the one in a jar of Smuckers for example.

4,Can I keep mulled wine on the stove for longer,"I'll be making [mulled wine](http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/recipe/jamie-s-mulled-wine/) for the very first time. I'll be preparing it an hour in advance, more or less.


Once I've completed the recipe can I keep it on the stove on low or low-mid setting for another hour or two without risking any unpleasant taste to it ? If not, how can I keep it warm to hot for that long at home ?


",<wine><drinks><reheating>,2016-12-21 09:24:52.843,76677,3,"I don't think you will get any off taste, but it will change the nature of your drink - at the minimum, it will be much less alcoholic afterwards, likely far more concentrated, and possibly more spiced (depending on whether straining the spices out is something you would think to do before this long simmer)


Looking at your recipe, it looks like a mulled wine flavored syrup added to wine - the actual quantity of wine is supposed to only be heated briefly to prevent the alcohol from evaporating out. The recipe actually mentions this as a reason why the spices are infused into a syrup first, instead of the whole quantity of wine - the boiling would evaporate quite a bit of alcohol out of the wine, I think [about 25%](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/659/cooking-away-alcohol) would be lost if you simmered for an hour.


If you still wanted to keep your mulled wine hot for an hour or two, I would suggest you look for mulled wine recipes that do have extended heating of the wine (maybeso something like [this](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/154602/hot-spiced-christmas-wine/?internalSource=staff%20pick&referringId=17698&referringContentType=recipe%20hub&clickId=cardslot%202), though it's just the first I saw), the better to balance the spices so they don't over-infuse on you on one hand, or have the wine over-concentrate them. If you want your mulled wine to still be strongly alcoholic, you might add some spirits at the end, just before serving to balance the loss.


So, yeah, the summery is, the wine will likely not be spoiled, or develop off flavors, just by being heated for extended periods of time, this happens in recipes, including mulled wine recipes, often enough for serious problems to be unlikely - though it will change your recipe's effects. The loss of alcohol is a factor, but it can be compensated for. The level of the spices might be tricky to manage - you might want less of you're going to be simmering them in the wine the whole time, you might get less out of them (ie, need more) if you only simmered them in the wine and skipped the hard boiling syrup stage (it might balance out?), or you might simply strain them out of the syrup before adding the rest of the wine.


Of course, you might find it easier to prepare the syrup in advance, and add to the wine and heat them both just before serving - this would make the recipe quick to assemble and sidestep some of the complexities that simmering that long might cause. One of the comments on the recipe even suggested this might add a touch of complexity to the drink, since the flavors would have a bit more time to meld together.

I understand that you can either punch or fold dough before shaping it and both have different benefits. This recipe doesn’t mention this step, though. Is it just supposed to be understood that I’ll have to punch it before shaping or do they intend that I somehow divide and shape it without knocking the dough down. Also, would I punch the dough down twice? Once when dividing and again right before shaping?

> 
> I understand that you can either punch or fold dough before shaping it and both have different benefits.
> 
>

Just understand what you're doing. During the fermentation process (rising), yeast consumes sugar and starch in the dough and turns it into alcohol, carbon dioxide, etc. That carbon dioxide collects gets trapped in the dough (thanks largely to the gluten), and bubbles form. Those bubbles (along with good flavor) are a big reason we ferment dough in the first place, so you want to keep most of them, but you also don't want large bubbles that'll create big empty lumps in your pizza.


""Punching down"" the dough and folding it accomplish the same things: the idea is to release the gas from the large bubbles, and also to shift the yeast cells around a bit after they've used up all the food that's available in their immediate vicinities. You don't really have to *punch* the dough with force like you're angry at it, although some people (especially on TV) like to make a show of doing so. You can just press your hand down into the risen dough so that some of the gas gets pressed out. Removing the dough from its bowl and folding/kneading it a little bit does the same thing, and probably also helps develop the gluten a bit.



> 
> This recipe doesn’t mention this step, though. Is it just supposed to be understood that I’ll have to punch it before shaping or do they intend that I somehow divide and shape it without knocking the dough down.
>

Yes, dividing the dough and forming balls will do exactly the same thing as punching it down, perhaps a bit more gently. Forming balls will also give you a nice round shape that'll turn into a disc as the dough relaxes, and that disc will be easy to form into a nicely shaped pizza.


Given the long fermentation time, I'll bet the recipe you're using calls for a relatively small amount of yeast. Between that and retarding the fermentation in the refrigerator, it may be that you won't get the kind of large bubbles of CO2 that you'd get with more yeast and shorter rise time, and without large bubbles there's no need to punch down the dough.



> 
> Also, would I punch the dough down twice? Once when dividing and again right before shaping?
> 
> 
> 


No, there's no need for that. Shaping the pizza will break any large bubbles. Sometimes large bubbles will start to form as you're shaping the pizza, or even after you've put it in the oven, and it's fine to pop those with the tip of a knife if you want to.

2. If it's milky tea, it you probably didn't put lemon in it, because let's face it, that'd be gross unless you have a thing for curdled milk.
3. Time - you said it's been there since this morning
4. Temperature - at room temperature
5. Oxygen - I doubt this is space tea or that it was stored in a vacuum.
6. Moisture - it's a cup of infused water and milk. Doesn't get much more moist than that.

0,What determines the length of sous vide cooking time?,"What factors affect sous vide cooking time, generally? I imagine cooking time is essentially the amount of time needed for the food's internal temperature to reach equilibrium with the desired temperature. Are there pros or cons to cooking longer or shorter?


*For reference, I am primarily interested in cooking custard base sous vide, but would be interested in responses with regard to other food types as well.*


",<sous-vide>,2017-07-17 19:20:50.677,83044,3,"Specifically for custard, you pretty much want the known good time from your recipe, but cooking longer will be fine.


In general, there are two major things:


* how long does it take to get everything up to the desired temperature?
* how long does it need to stay at that temperature?


The time to reach the desired temperature is pretty much just determined by size/shape. If there's a point in the middle that's 5cm from the closest surface, whether it's a 10cm diameter sphere or a 10cm thick slab, it's going to take longer. (The two aren't exactly the same in terms of heat propagation, but it's a good rough way to think about it.) I'm guessing liquids like your custard base also cook a little faster than solids, since there can be a little bit of convection flow inside the bag, not enough to be well-mixed, but better heat transfer than a solid.


The time at the target temperature depends greatly on what you're cooking. With many things, you just have to reach the temperature and then you're done. Holding at the target temperature after that might make no difference, or it might result in slow loss of quality. For example, you can hold steak quite a while at temperature, with not much change. On the other hand, you don't want to hold fish forever, because it'll tend to lose texture. And with something like pork shoulder or brisket, you actually *need* the long cooking time in order to slowly break down connective tissue and get it tender.


So, if you already have a time you know works:


* Cooking shorter means underdone, either under temperature, or not tender.
* Cooking longer means avoiding the risk of undercooking, and is generally fine, especially in moderation. For some things, it may overcook, like making your meat fall apart *too* easily.


For custard, the former is obviously bad (you want it to actually set), but the latter is not really an issue (it's not going to rapidly un-set).


As a footnote, there are some sous vide recipes designed to not actually reach equilibrium temperature. For example, you can cook eggs at a temperature high enough to set the whites, but for a shorter time to avoid firmly setting the yolks. Those are more like ""normal"" cooking in terms of over- and under-cooking, e.g. for the eggs, too long and you set the yolk, too short and you don't set the whites.

1,How long to stir-fry vegetables to retain most nutrients?,"If I need to stir-fry vegetables, how long is the ideal time? I like stir-frying vegetables (almost my staple food) but I don't want to lose much of the nutrients.

I personally do not like to cook with that kind of a heat, it is just too violent. Instead, I let the vegetable to stay in room temperature and cook them with medium heat, in a regular non-stick pan. However, I stop cooking them while they are still firm, lightly golden and vibrant.

I'm interested in making this bread: [King Arthur Flour Caraway Rye](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2013/03/01/caraway-rye-bread-deli-cious/). The recipe recommends the addition of vital wheat gluten or King Arthur's rye bread improver. This is how the King Arthur product is described on the web site: ""A blend of rye flavors and sours, diastatic malt, vital wheat gluten (for a good, strong rise) and potato flour (to help combat the ""dry crumblies"")"". I'm disinclined to buy the King Arthur product mostly because their shipping fees to Alaska are ridiculous, and also because I've been meaning to try this: [Honeyville Dough Conditioner](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0097FMQVK). But am I missing something without ""rye flavors and sours""?

It looks like the ""sour"" flavor comes from several acids (acetic, lactic, and citric). I assume the recipe calls for ""sour"" flavor instead of being a sourdough recipe like a traditional rye bread would be. Pickle juice may be a good substitute, since it's mainly vinegar [i.e. acetic acid]. The ""bread improver"" also includes wheat gluten, which may be helpful if you're using a non-bread flour (bread flour contains more gluten than whole wheat or AP flours).

4,Egg temperature for meringue,"All the experts insist that a meringue **must** be made with room-temperature eggs. Why?


I ask because my experience runs completely opposite, at least when it comes to flourless/nut-based desserts where the principal (possibly only) ingredients are egg whites, sugar, and nut meal. If I fold the nuts into a meringue that started with room-temperature eggs, it collapses dramatically. If the meringue started with cold eggs, it still loses some volume when the nuts are added, but not nearly as much. Also, baking the cold meringue is much less likely to result in a runny mess.


Am I doing something wrong, or is there a secret exception to the room-temperature rule that people neglect to mention?


",<eggs><temperature><meringue>,2010-11-01 17:51:31.397,8740,1,"I don't think you're doing anything wrong; if it works, then don't fix it! The truth is that the process of beating the eggs will warm them up to room temperature quite quickly anyway--keep in mind that meringues are up to 90% air. 


As for stability, additives like sugar and cream of tartar will have more of an effect than will temperature of the eggs. The addition of sugar absorbs the water that squeezes out of the tightly packed bubbles and helps separate the proteins, resulting in stability. You want to add the sugar after beating the eggs into a foam, and use a superfine sugar so that it won't end up grainy.

Pan sauces made with wine, vinegar, or any other acid are better in stainless steel. If you put any acid in cast-iron, you are harming your seasoning, and leeching iron into your food. This *will* affect the taste of your sauces, I find pan sauces taste metallic when made in cast iron.


Stainless steel also heats up and cools down *much* faster than cast-iron. This is great when you need quick heat, or fine control of your heat. You can also plunge a piping hot stainless pan into an ice-bath without cracking it in half.

Go with a a bonded stainless-steel pan with an aluminum core. The most well known manufacturer is [All-Clad](http://www.all-clad.com/about-all-clad/Our-Craftsmanship/). The stainless steel exterior is great due to it's non reactivity, you can literally put anything in it. The aluminum core distributes the heat much more quickly and evenly, minimizing hot-spots.

Not in my opinion. I go with a non-stick pan every time.

I have to recommend sticking with a nonstick pan for eggs. There's simply nothing better, although well seasoned cast iron comes awful close. If you're spending more than $20 for a nonstick egg pan, you're doing it wrong. You don't need Calphalon, or any other big name for a good nonstick pan. Go to a restaurant supply store if you can and buy a cheap one there. With care it should last you 2-5 years depending on use. I found my current one at a Bed Bath & Beyond.

0,Microwave Asparagus?,"I have a ton of asparagus but no time to cook it the traditional steamer way. Is there a recommended microwave method someone would recommend? Earlier today I sliced some into 2 inch bits, put them in a bowl together with lemon juice, butter, and garlic. It was DECENT at best.


Any ideas?


",<microwave><asparagus>,2014-03-05 00:29:19.377,42520,2,"I would not recommend using the microwave for two reasons:


* It does not scale up well as you add mass to the cooking chamber
* The shape and size of asparagus is almost designed to fit into the fact that microwave ovens tend to cook unevenly


Instead, if you wish to cook a large amount of asparagus in a reasonably short period of time, I recommend roasting. The method is very forgiving, but an approach similar to this will give you good results:


* Preheat your oven to approximately 400 F / 200 C.
* Clean and trim your asparagus.
* Please the asparagus in a shallow layer on a sheet pan, and season with salt, pepper, herbs, olive oil, and/or lemon juice as you desire.
* Roast approximately 10-15 minutes until it is slightly browned, and cooked through to your liking


While this technique does not cook a small amount of asaparagus terribly quickly, it does not get any slower for larger batches, and so is probably your most effective method.


Also, many people consider the outcome especially delicious, more so than steaming or microwaving.

",<equipment><soup><resources>,2013-01-15 13:40:59.250,30108,7,"The modern way is still to sieve.


I actually did this a couple of days ago. I made a sauce out of boiled onions, capiscums, chilli peppers, canned plum tomatoes, carrots, garlic, ginger and spices. This was then whizzed in a blender and sieved through a fine metal sieve to remove the pulp, seeds, large fibrous pieces that wern't blended.


It makes for a smoother sauce.


The fine metal sieves are fairly cheap and easy to obtain. There are also finer sieves made from plastic or even muslin you can also use.

One option (if you don't have a centrifuge, of course) would be to remove the pits, then gently blend (you may want to avoid heating too much in a powerful blender) with the enzyme, pectinase, commonly branded Pectinex Ultra SPL (Available through mail order). This is an enzyme that destroys pectin. Let your mixture rest, then filter. If you are not so worried about the impact of heat on flavor, the enzyme works faster when heated to 122F (50C).

2,whipped cream icing beforehand vs right before serving,"I found a recipe of a chocolate poke cake with chocolate ganache in the holes and a whipped cream icing that it's supposed to be only on top, and then with pecans and chocolate flakes and dulce de leche.

I'd like to eliminate the dulce de leche and I wonder whether the cake can be done (decorated I mean) a few hours before serving and kept in the fridge.

0,Plums are sour. Why are prunes sweet?,"Plums are sour (especially the peel). Prunes are dried plums (with the peel, I presume). Then why are prunes only sweet, with no sourness?


Note: I'm asking about standard American prunes, not unusual varieties like sour prunes. 


",<dried-fruit>,2019-03-03 15:14:34.660,96693,3,"Prunes are made from specific varieties of plums which are different than many plums eaten fresh, though they are also often available and eaten fresh. When picked as fresh fruit however, they are often picked much less ripe than for prunes to allow for shipping and sitting before eating. If they are ripe, sourness is definitely a matter of taste, I for instance find a fully ripe prune plum to be very slightly tart near the skin, the least ripe part of the fruit. I also find that same fruit to be very off-putting and near rotted tasting. That is simply the nature of that fruit. By the time the outer part is fully ripe, the inner flesh has already started to brown, but has not been dried to prune like nature yet.


The acid does not vanish, though some is converted to other compounds including sugars as the fruit fully ripens, the bigger factor is that more sugar forms. Once dried and more concentrated, the sugars simply overpower the acids and dominate the flavor.

28,Why use a kettle to heat water?,"Whenever I need to heat up water for a French press or hot chocolate, I do it in the microwave. Is there a good reason to use a kettle instead of the microwave to heat water? 


",<microwave><water><kettle>,2016-11-20 02:13:01.820,75671,34,"Bear in mind that I'm using an electric kettle, rather than a stove-top one.


First, the advantage of a kettle is that it is quite efficient, and turns itself off once the water is boiling.
This as opposed to the microwave, which only stops after a set time, rather than relying on the condition of the water. 


Second, a microwave can cause water to superheat, particularly in a ceramic or glass container. This means that there is a certain risk that the water will ""jump out"" at you once you add something to it or put a spoon in.


Additionally, most kettles have more power than the average microwave, so the kettle is probably faster to boil water.

3,How would you make a roux efficiently?,"Making a big batch of roux is a hassle, so I'm investigating how to make my life a bit easier.


According to '[Ideas in food](http://blog.ideasinfood.com/ideas_in_food/2010/02/roux-in-a-jar.html)', you can make roux in a jar in a pressure cooker. Nice, but the quantity is too little for my needs.


In the Cajun cuisine you can make [roux for gumbo](http://www.realcajunrecipes.com/recipes/cajun/oven-made-roux/927.rcr) in the oven. That won't work for me as I need it to work as a thickening agent. Maybe it would work at a lower temperature.


The problem is to lose the raw flour taste. I'm thinking of mixing the butter-flour as always, on the stove-top. Then transfer the batter to a sous vide bag and let it bathe for 12 h at 85ºC (at which point the starches should be gelatinized).


What do you think? Is 12h too long or too short? Is 85ºC high enough to lose the raw flavour?


",<sous-vide><roux>,2013-03-24 15:37:22.270,32968,4,"In a roux, the starches are not normally gelatinized during the production of the roux--in fact, if you make your roux with oil rather than butter, there is no water present (other than latent moisture from the flour) to do so.


Roux thickened sauces must normally be brought to the boil; this is when the actual gelatinization takes place.


. . .


Roux is easy to prepare in larger batches, stove top. Simple use a larger pan, such as a six quart dutch oven. 


Melt your butter or add your oil, then whisk in the flour. Cook for a couple of minutes (after the bubbling subsides if using butter), and you are good to go. Don't be afraid to turn the heat up as long as you are standing by, watching and stirring to prevent burning from hot spots.


Butter can foam up considerably, so use a large pot in comparison to the quantity of roux.


For dark roux, I would start stove top, and finish in the oven to reduce the likelihood of taking the browning too far, and reduce the labor of stirring required.


The roux can be refrigerated. You can scoop it with a spoon and add it to sauce at the simmer and whisk, and it will thicken almost instantly.

6,Lump Charcoal vs Briquettes and variations in brands,"I've been experimenting with BBQ on a variety of smokers for the past few years.


Originally I tried some Kingsford Briquettes and had a hard time managing the temperature. There was an excessive amount of ash generated that seemed to choke out the fire. I did a little research and found that clay is added to briquettes to give them their shape, and this was likely the cause of all the ash.


Since then (until recently), I've used lump charcoal and have been fairly happy with the results.


This summer I mistakenly purchased another bag of briquettes - Stubbs brand - and I've been using that ever since. This charcoal seems to burn hotter and longer than the lump and without the excessive amount of ash I found when using the Kingsford.


Have others experienced this as well? 


* Do briquetes burn hotter and longer (in general) than lump?
* Is Kingford a very ""ashy"" charcoal or maybe did I just get a bad bag?


",<grilling><barbecue><shopping>,2010-08-05 15:16:38.423,4342,10,"When you're talking about briquettes, much of the ""ash"" you're talking about is actually clay and binders to hold the briquette together. That also tends to mean a cooler burning form of charcoal.


Overall, charcoal is made by taking wood (or a few other materials, but usually hardwood) and heating it to burning temperatures without enough oxygen for it to actually burn. The result is something that burns more cleanly and steadily than the original wood, which burns a fairly volatile way until it gets down to coal. That means that charcoal sort of ""skips"" the volatile burn and gets right to the steady cooking burn.


Briquettes are lots of little bits of charcoal, bound together with those binding materials into the little forms in the bag. Lump charcoal is just chunks of wood that go through the process and come out the other end still sort of resembling the piece of wood that went in.


Lump charcoal burns much hotter than briquettes and, since there are no binders or fillers, very little is left behind when you're done. However, it tends to burn out faster too, meaning for a long fire (like for slow smoking pork), you'll need to refill with lump charcoal more often than for briquettes.


Kingsford (which dominates at least the US market) is a company that comes directly from when Henry Ford really came up with the process for making charcoal. For most of that time, they've pretty much stuck to the same form factor with the binders, and focused on adding things like a few shavings of mesquite or pre-soaking them with petroleum-based lighter fluids. 


However, recently, they've introduced a ""competition"" briquette that is actually much closer in how it burns to lump charcoal and has fewer of the binders in it. While I generally prefer to use lump charcoal, I wasn't nearly as disappointed when I tried these new briquettes.

190 g butter
4 g Of salt
5 ml of milk
250 g of flour.

",<dough><quiche>,2013-04-19 09:46:13.730,33611,3,"According to the title of the video, which is all I looked at (my French not being that good), you are making a *pate brisee* which is a particular kind of pastry crust.


This pastry relies on *solid* fat in its construction method, so that it can be in little clumps in the dough. Then, it melts during baking forming a crumbly crust.


You will not achieve ideal results with any liquid shortening such as olive oil. Some viable options (which may actually achieve better results, depending on your desires) to substitute for all or part of the butter include:


* Hydrogenated vegetable shortening (such as the US brand Crisco)
* Lard
* Beef tallow


Basically, any fat which is solid at room temperature (almost always animal fats, since typically only saturated fats are solid at room temperature) will do.

If you google ""olive oil pastry crust"", you will find recipes such as [this one from Fuss Free Cooking](http://www.fussfreecooking.com/meatless-recipes/olive-oil-shortcrust-pastry/) which are not based on butter or solid shortening.

2,Should you wash beef before freezing?,"I have bought a 3 kg vacuum-sealed package of ribeye steaks. The steaks are very fresh and are essentially floating in blood.


I would like to repackage the steaks one by one, so that I can thaw them separately. Should I wash them before freezing, or is it ok to directly package them in plastic wrap as they are?


",<food-safety><freezing><beef>,2018-09-27 21:51:38.147,92514,6,"Just a note, a pet peeve of mine and something that may help you feel better, that red liquid is not blood. It is Myoglobin, a protein that found only in muscle. Blood tends to spoil very rapidly and meat which was not properly drained of blood will typically spoil or at least taste unlike what you want. Myoglobin however as it ages is what helps give aged meat its distinct, and for many, better flavor. When meat is seared, it also contributes to the caramelized crust, another level of flavor many like. 
 Myoglobin is related to Hemoglobin, red blood cells, and works with it to deliver oxygen to the muscle, but it is not the same and does not age the same.


As to what to do when repacking, well, as comments have given multiple answers, I would also say that is personal choice. For me, best taste is to still have some, but a lot of the liquid is just messy, so I would tend to pat some off but not rinse or wash. Rinse if you prefer, but I certainly would not soak or scrub. When you thaw, almost certainly more will be released from the steak, so in the end the results will likely be about the same between patting and leaving it. I would just think you will want to minimize introducing ice crystals which may reduce the quality of the frozen and thawed meat.

20,Is it ok to store open cans in the fridge?,"I'd been taught growing up that you should never store canned food in the fridge in the open can. Is there any scientific basis to this, or is it just an old wives tale? 


What types of foods should not be stored in their can once open? Would olives, for example, be harmed from this sort of storage? Or only more acidic foods like tomato paste or pineapple be affected?


",<food-safety>,2013-01-28 21:17:22.870,30509,21,"Short answer: storing food in an open can is normally safe for a short period, but inadvisable. 


Longer answer:
There are three main issues with storing foods in an open can. They are metal oxidation, contamination, and funk.


1. Oxidation. As commenters have observed, cans used to be made of tin, which is toxic. Modern cans are made from either steel or aluminum. If the contents of the can are acidic, cans are lined with a polymer (plastic) inner layer. If that layer is broken -- say, by a major dent in the can or by using a knife to scrape out contents -- then the acid can get to the metal and, over time, corrode it, and some of the now-oxidized metal will dissolve into the food. As far as we know, the oxidized metal is not toxic, but it tastes horrible.
2. Contamination. Any open container of food can become contaminated when an airborne water droplet (tiny -- microns wide) containing a nasty microbe drips or settles into it. The major biological culprit here is Listeria, which can grow in any moist environment, including spaces refrigerated below 40F (5C). Also, if juices from your raw meat drips onto an upper shelf, which later gets wiped inadvertently into your container of ready-to-eat food, you are likely to get Salmonella or E coli. This risk can be mitigated if you keep your raw meats on the lowest shelf, but not eliminated. Also, it is worth noting that contamination through this pathway is a relatively rare event -- but even so, it is not worth the risk.
3. Funk. Have you ever put an ice cube in your beverage and notice your beverage tastes strange? The chemical compounds that give food their flavor tend to be volatile (meaning they will readily leave the food into the surrounding air). Also, the mustiness of a refrigerator/freezer is due to volatile compounds produced by mold and mildew. Foods that are wet and/or fatty can be molecular velcro to these compounds.

2,Why does Tomato Sauce (ketchup) require refrigeration but Barbecue sauce (like Worcestershire sauce) does not?,"We have two types of sauce we put on our sausages.

The Tomato sauce indicates it needs refrigeration but the Barbecue sauce (made by the same company) does not say this. 


My question is **Why does Tomato Sauce (ketchup) require refrigeration but Barbecue sauce (like Worcestershire sauce) does not?**


",<food-safety><sauce><refrigerator><barbecue-sauce><ketchup>,2014-01-03 03:01:43.247,40827,6,"You [don't actually have to refrigerate ketchup](http://www.stilltasty.com/questions/index/25). Once it's opened it's good for a month or so with no appreciable change. After that the flavour and colour starts to degrade, but it's still safe to eat.


Worcestershire sauce is fermented for more than a year before it's bottled, so it will change at a much slower rate than an acidic, but unfermented sauce like ketchup. Still, it's only good for a few years after it's opened.

",<steak><sous-vide><pressure-cooker>,2016-07-21 07:43:51.610,71576,22,"I'm afraid you have gotten something wrong.


*[Sous-vide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sous-vide)* and *pressure cooking* are, as far as food physics is concerned, on the opposite ends of the scale.


* Pressure cooking allows you to increase the boiling point of water, thus reducing the cooking time. (Bad idea for a tender steak, btw., as soon as you exceed a certain temperature, the proteins in the meat change irreversibly and the meat gets tough.)
* Sous-vide uses temperatures way below the boiling point, combined with a very extended cooking time. This means you can safely and slowly bring your steak to the desired core temperature without the risk of overcooking and thus toughening the meat. A final sear is just a finishing touch, not technically a necessity for cooking the meat. (But don't skip it, it's for flavour and eye appeal!)


So no, we can't give you a temperature / time chart for steak in a pressure cooker - because the results would be very unsatisfactory.

16,How can I get homemade yoghurt to thicken properly?,"Pretty much always when I make yoghurt myself, the homemade version comes out much thinner, much more liquid, than the store-bought yoghurt that is used to produce my yoghurt. How can I make it thicker? Should I increase/decrease the temperature? Add other ingredients (I just heat milk, add yoghurt, stir it, and then put it away in a closed container for 10 hours or so)? 


Any general ideas on how to make yoghurt thicker? 


*Edit* 


Current Procedure:


* I take the milk from the fridge and I start heating this directly.
* Right from the start, I also add the yoghurt, straight from the fridge as well.
* I'll continuously (slowly) stir the milk
* Once it reaches about 40 degrees Centigrade I'll take it off (but perhaps my rustic measure with the temperature is off)
* I then put the lid on the pan I used to heat the milk, wrap this in blankets, and put it away overnight.
* Next morning, yoghurt is ready - but quite liquid.


",<yogurt>,2012-09-12 10:03:57.550,34026,17,"There are many myths surrounding yogurt making:
===============================================


* UHT milk is bad. This is simply not true. I have made yogurt with whole fat UHT milk for years and it comes out nice and thick. In fact for the past several months I have been using a high quality whole milk powder that makes a lovely, thick yogurt.
* Store bought yogurt will always be thicker because of additives. Also not true. My yogurt is as thick as a high fat sour cream and contains no added milk powder, gelatine, etc.
* You need many hours of 'fermentation' to make yogurt. Again I don't agree. My yogurt sets in 3-4 hours, after which it goes in the fridge to cool and finish the culturing process.
* The milk must be exactly x temperature when you add the starter. This is only somewhat true. As long as the milk is at or below 45°C it is fine. If you can stand the temperature, so can the bacteria—ie, if you can hold a finger in it for ~10 sec, it's ok. That said, too low and you're losing some effects of the protein denature explained below.
* Everything must be sterilized. This is only somewhat true. Clean everything carefully, of course, but you are adding a starter with billions of cultivated bacteria into an ideal environment for it to grow. It will easily dominate other bacteria that happen to get in—and they will, since there are bacteria in the air all around us, so even post-sterilization there will be plenty of foreign stuff entering the yogurt. That said, an over-long incubation will give other bacteria a chance to express themselves, so best to avoid that.
* Don't move, touch, or cause the yogurt to shake in any way during incubation or it will fail. I used to believe this myself but it's really not that sensitive. Obviously less agitation is better, but it will not fail even with fairly substantial movement during the incubation. Drinking yogurt is shaken quite violently during incubation in order to keep it liquid and even then it's still quite viscous.


The keys to making good thick yogurt are:
=========================================


* Protein. The milk becomes solid because of a protein in the milk, and for that to happen, the protein must first be heated to above 70°C. I heat it to 75-80°C for just a few minutes and it still turns out very thick. A milk with high quality protein will make a great yogurt.
* Incubation temperature. If you want to make good yogurt in 3-4 hours (beyond which it will not get thicker, only more sour), it must be incubated at a steady 40-45°C. A lower temperature will also produce yogurt, but you are in a race with other bacteria, so the quicker it's done the better. Buy a 75-cent indoor thermometer and start looking for ways to create the right temperature environment.
* Time between generations. Try to bake a new batch every 4-5 days. After a week in the fridge the bacteria are starting to suffer and will not be as strong and active when introduced into the next batch. A short generation cycle will let you go on making yogurt with the same culture for dozens of generations.
* Sugar quantity. This is my own personal guess based on bread making, etc. A little sugar will boost the bacteria, but too much will slow it down. I use 2 tbsp per litre of milk and it works very well. Tart with a hint of sweet. Up to double this amount should be fine but more *could* affect it. Like I say I'm guessing here but it seems to make sense.


Two final notes.
----------------


* The ""water"" that separates out of the yogurt is whey protein—generally seen as a very healthy thing to eat. A firm yogurt will let you pour it or spoon it off if you don't like it, but there's no reason not to just scoop it out with the rest or stir it back in.
* Fat content is important, but the milk protein is what will make or break the yogurt. I have made a very thick yogurt with skim milk powder or skim milk with added skim milk powder. Soy milk, which has quite a bit less fat than whole milk, makes a very solid yogurt. It's all about solids. Of course a >3.x% whole fat milk will produce a tastier yogurt, because milk fat is oh so tasty!

keep the fridge door closed as much as possible
wait for food to cool down before you put it in the fridge

He has another article about sous vide ( <http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/03/how-to-sous-vide-steak.html> ) where he claims that you don't need to let the meat rest after searing. This is the one that originally led me to not need to rest the steak.


Looks like there is some resting that is required. Will post up with results next time I make some steak.


",<steak><sous-vide>,2011-09-17 11:06:44.377,17861,12,"Pretty much...yes, but you can fix it!.


When you properly sous vide or *very* slow cook anything, you'll retain more of the myoglobin color because of the even cooking that often doesn't go above 140 *at all*. So a properly cooked steak like this will retain much more of its red colored myoglobin. Simply put, the meat will have more red juices to release! (Its a great, great thing about sous vide.)


As @Ronald mentions, the other thing is the resting of the meat. It's an important step as the muscle fibers relax after the heat is off and hold juices better then. An often misstep for the home cook is they allow a hot piece of meat to rest on a flat, solid surface. This causes the bottom of the meat to steam against the board, open the fibers in the meat more, and release the juices on to the board. Rest your meat on a raised baking rack so that it has air circulation all around it. 


After a short rest - for most steak 10 minutes is fine, then you can cut into the steak. Use a very sharp knife to slice. The meat here is essentially a sponge and you don't want to compress it and squeeze out the juices. A dull knife will do this and you'll lose more juice on the cutting board again. Use a sharp knife and apply steady, even, but light pressure while slicing - let the edge do the work (if it won't, sharpen the knife more).

5,How long will fermented/brined pickles last?,"I've been interested in making some pickles, and a lot of the places I've found say that salt brined or fermented pickles generally taste better than acid-brined pickles. That is, pickles pickled in a saltwater brine taste better those pickled in vinegar. While that's subjective, it's still gotten me intrigued in saltwater brining some vegetables. 


However, each of the sources I find give me a different estimate for how long they last in the fridge. Some say 1 week (too short, surely?) and some say up to 1 year (that seems *too* long...). So my question is, how long will a pickle last in its brine after being put into the fridge? 


Edit: After some thinking, I guess it would depend on a lot of factors, but mostly the salinity of the water and the temperature of the fridge. Given that these are the most important factors (but I could be wrong!) if the temperature is [35 deg F in the ideal fridge](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/4529/what-temperatures-should-i-keep-my-refrigerator-and-freezer-set-at), how will salt content change how long the pickle will last?


",<storage-lifetime><brining><pickling>,2014-05-30 19:40:04.227,44763,8,"The short answer is **1-2 years for traditional pickles**, assuming a good recipe with adequate salt content and fermentation time (traditionally anywhere from a month to a few months). For modern **quick fermented** homemade recipes, where the pickles are fermented in a *week or so* instead of months, I'd recommend using them up within **a month or two**.


Some representative sources (note the bolded bits about fermentation time):


* ""Fermented or processed pickles also have a very long shelf-life, **about two years**."" ([source](http://books.google.com/books?id=CvIl2k8jGgMC&lpg=PA245&ots=S0gpc0Mmc8&dq=fermented%20pickles%20shelf%20life&pg=PA245#v=onepage&q=fermented%20pickles%20shelf%20life&f=false))
* ""FERMENTED PICKLES: The oldest method of pickling, when a naturally occurring bacteria transforms the sugars present in the ingredient into an acid, preserving the food. These are called 'processed' pickles, and though they take **as many as five weeks to cure**, **they last up to 2 years**."" ([source](http://www.nyfoodmuseum.org/_pkwhat.htm))
* ""The product is completely **fermented in 3-6 weeks**.... In contrast to salt stock brining procedures [i.e., pickles removed from their liquid after fermentation and stored in a very heavily salted tank for future processing], genuine dill pickles do not require desalting and are often sold with the filtered fermentation liquor that is produced during the process. The product must be consumed **within 12 months**."" ([source](http://books.google.com/books?id=p-iy24GEE0wC&lpg=PA172&dq=fermented%20pickles%20shelf%20life&pg=PA172#v=onepage&q=fermented%20pickles%20shelf%20life&f=false))


While these are common estimates, many books on the subject won't even give such shelf-life estimates (e.g., Sandor Katz's *The Art of Fermentation*), because there is so much variability depending on recipe and storage conditions during and after fermentation.


The other issue is that fermented brined pickles are ""alive"" in the sense that they continue to have microbial activity even after refrigerated. Unless you ""process"" the pickles after fermentation by heating to a high temperature and canning, you should expect that pickles will change their taste and texture continuously. You might like pickles that are ""just finished,"" but dislike their flavor or texture after a month or two in the fridge (or the reverse).


Traditional pickle-makers often take advantage of these changes, for example by selling ""half sours"" which taste like something between a fresh cucumber and a pickle and have only been partially fermented. ""Half sours"" and other pickles that have not completed fermentation before refrigeration have a much shorter shelf-life (usually a few weeks), because the lack of full acidity in the liquid and remaining sugars and other nutrients in the cucumbers may still allow other things to grow and for spoilage to occur.


Even after a longer fermentation, expect pickles to gradually get more sour and to soften in texture as the months go by. However, with adequate salt content and full fermentation, and as long as you are not contaminating the storage container, there's no reason to expect they will actually ""go bad"" at refrigerator temperatures for at least a few months and potentially much longer.


Traditionally, long-storage pickled cucumbers were fermented in (and subsequently stored in) a cool place, like a root cellar or other underground compartment, which probably stayed around 50-55 degrees Fahrenheit most of the year. At these cooler temperatures, pickles usually needed to ferment for at least a month and sometimes a few months before achieving full flavor. Since the root cellar temperatures were often above refrigerator temperatures, they would then continue to get even more sour and gradually begin to break down as the months went by. However, the purpose of storage was to have cucumbers available throughout the year, so last year's batch would be used up and then be replaced by the new harvest.


Today, most people tend to ferment homemade pickles faster (often at room temperature) and often with less salt than the season-long ferments of the past would use. This produces pickles more quickly, sometimes in as little as a week or so, with pickles that are not as extreme in their sourness and saltiness as the long-storage pickling of the past. The flavor profile can also be somewhat different, due to greater activity of some microorganisms at room temperature. Depending on the recipe, they are often not as stable and should probably be consumed within a few weeks or months. (For example, Alton Brown's relatively fast pickle [recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/dill-pickles-recipe.html) recommends storing the pickles no longer than two months in the refrigerator.)

3,"Will freezing a bottle of vermouth change it's quality, life length or properties?","I accidentally froze an unopened bottle of white Vermouth. I've read that opening the bottle will cause the vermouth to slowly oxidase and you should finish the bottle within a month or so. How is it with a frozen bottle - does that matter?

In fact you can wait until it's partly thawed, give it a good shake, and hey presto, vermouth slushy, which goes in some cocktails rather well. Fortified wines do slowly oxidise on exposure to the atmosphere, but this is greatly slowed by the alcohol content. Historically this was one the principle reasons for fortifying wines - so that they store better and last longer.

0,Pan sauce without meat,"I like pan sauces with my chicken or beef, but prefer the meat cooked over cast iron. Pan sauces apparently don't work well in cast iron, and should be done in a stainless steel saute pan.


How can I make a nice pan sauce if the meat has been cooked in a different pan?


The best I can think of is to save a small amount of the meat to be cooked into fond to start the sauce off. Will that work?


",<sauce><cast-iron><stainless-steel>,2016-07-11 02:02:11.747,71357,0,"I think de-glazing the cast iron pan would be a good solution.

Add this to your sauce to get the meat flavor into it.


Liquids you can use include: wine, stock, water, beer, probably a lot of other stuff. And the type of liquid to use would depend on the dish and personal preference.

2,Vegan mayonnaise never emulsifies?,"I'm beginning to think this whole ""egg-free mayonnaise"" thing is an extremely elaborate practical joke. I have exhausted all the tips Google has yielded, so I'm hoping someone on here has an idea what else I might be doing wrong.


Here's my basic recipe (variations I've tried are listed below):  

1/2 cup soy milk  

1 cup sunflower oil  

1/2 tsp salt  

1/2 tsp mustard  

1 tsp vinegar  

1 tsp lemon juice  

Combine everything but the oil and whisk.  

Add the oil in super tiny amounts, whisking like crazy each time.


Result: a very homogeneous white soup the consistency of water. There are no visible oil droplets. It takes about ten to fifteen minutes for the first oil droplets to appear, and a few hours for an actual layer of oil to form.


Soy milk and oil are both at precisely 28°C (82°F).


Things I've tried so far: 


* with a blender.
* with an immersion blender.
* with an electrical whisk.
* with a whisk.
* with a fork.
* on a boat. No, wait, that's Dr Seuss.
* add 1 or 5 tsp of soy lecithin. Does nothing, but despite soy lecithin's supposed tastelessness, the result tastes terribly of soy.
* have ingredients at 23°C (73°F) instead of 28°C.
* use oat milk instead of soy milk.
* use a warm water/soy flour mixture instead of soy milk.
* use a different oil.
* add xanthan. This makes a somewhat thicker, but terribly clumpy mixture that you really don't want to eat.
* different blender speeds.
* quadruple the amount of oil. This resulted in a much larger amount of soup.
* continue mixing for ten additional minutes. Resulted in my hand falling asleep from holding the hand mixer for so long.


I am so very out of ideas. Any help is greatly appreciated.


Edit: tried a few more things and added them to the list of things that do nothing.

I hope it's okay to answer my own question. For anyone who comes across this via Google in the future: I tried two different brands of organic soy milk with the same official ingredient list and no visible differences, and one consistently produces mayonnaise while the other consistently produces soup.

1,Should I not sear and broil eye of round the way that I do filet mignon or chuck tenderloin?,"I recently started cooking filet mignon for my wife (I hate steak/beef myself) every once in a while by (1) coating the steak in a melted butter rub (that has a bit of salt and pepper), then (2) searing each side for 2-3 minutes over medium-high heat, and finally (3) broiling in the oven for approximately 8 minutes. The results have been fantastic (or so she tells me), despite my mere aping of some instructions I found online.


After a while, I decided to try another cut, and repeated the same process with some 1-inch thick chuck tenderloin steaks. These happened to curl up quite a bit while searing, but the end result was apparently again quite delicious (and my wife liked their curled up shape to boot :-). So far so good.


Well, I tried the same method with some 1-inch thick eye of round steaks, and the results were quite disappointing. When I seared them, they failed to brown quickly, and perhaps because I then overdid the searing, the steaks came out pretty tough (and visually unappealing too IMO). Should I not have tried to cook this cut this way, or is that aspect just a red herring? **There was one other difference:** in my previous efforts, I completely neglected the idea of letting the steaks come to room temperature for a while before cooking, whereas this time I let the steaks sit out for a little over 30 minutes before proceeding. But since that is apparently what one is ""supposed"" to do, I wouldn't think that that would yield my one poor result so far, but I really don't know.

And even then, it's going to be a tough piece of meat.

Your method is sound for preparing a steak, but I would limit it to:


* Tenderloin
* Strip
* Ribeye
* Chuck eye (not chuck steak, which is a tough piece of meat, but chuck eye, which is cut from the eye roll).


If you want cheaper beef, the last in the list is your best bet.

To prevent this, be mindful of how much flour you add to your bench and how you shape your loaf. Especially with rather wet doughs, the impulse to flour generously to prevent it from sticking is obviously there. And while you can and probably want to flour what’s going to be the *outside* of the loaf, you should be careful about not working the floury parts *to the inside*. There are a few different methods how to solve that, if you search for shaping especially wet dough, you will find various methods that can also be used for medium hydration doughs. For example, [Foodgeek](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IxVSlizlt-s) has a nice video where you can see the shaping of a boule completely without bench flour and a batard with minimal flouring.

Keeping in line with the USDA's recommendations, you should let the dough rise for a maximum of two hours at room temperature, then move it into the fridge until it doubles in size (or until it rises appropriately).

6,Dutch oven bread - bottom always burns,"When I bake bread in my dutch oven, to get the bread crust a darker brown and where it should be, the bottom will burn. I've used several recipes and different ovens with the same problem outcome. The dutch oven is as high as I can put it in the oven, which helps but it's still burned slightly. 


The recipes always call for a pre-heat of 475F before the bread goes in, 25-30 top on 15-20 top off. I'm trying to adjust the temperature now, but I don't see how this isn't a more common problem. Any suggestions for this? 


",<baking><bread><dutch-oven>,2016-11-25 16:57:47.160,104889,7,"I've had the same issue at home, with a very hard or burnt crust bottom:


I've made the following adjustments through experimentation. This will help greatly, but might not fix the problem entirely. I routinely preheat my empty dutch oven in the oven set to 500F with the lid on. When baking, I take it down a notch to 475F. I do one or more of the following steps before I place the loaf in the hot dutch oven:


* **Convection:** I'll mention this first, because it makes the largest difference. If your oven has the convection baking feature (mine does not), enable it. It moves the heat around evenly, but it also helps the thermostat do its job properly and keep the set temperature.
* **Add a layer of semolina/cornmeal/flour:** Add a generous layer of durum wheat semolina at the bottom of the dutch oven. Don't worry about putting too much on. You can brush off the excess after baking. Whatever doesn't stick to your bread will just fall out of the dutch oven (no cleaning needed). I've also successfully used corn meal as a substitute, but corn meal has a tendency to caramelize a bit more if you leave it on the surface of the bread, and it also has a sweeter taste. The semolina will brown, but it will form a small heat barrier between the dutch oven and the loaf. I use parchment paper to transfer the loaf into the dutch oven, and so my semolina ends up *under* the paper. You can try semolina without parchment paper, but it will add texture to the bottom of your baked loaf (which can be quite good!)


You can also combine this with a layer of flour on the bread which will also protect the bottom somewhat, but not as much as semolina or cornmeal. Semolina has larger grain size and I find it provides additional ""spacing"". Also consider modifying the recipe, and roll your loaf in sesame seed when you add it to your proofing basket. I find this helps too, and you can scrape the dark ones off easily after baking. It also looks (and tastes) good.
* **Add a layer of chaff/bran:** If you mill your own flour, you can use a layer of chaff/bran (the stuff you sift out) at the bottom of the dutch oven. It's a good insulator. Brush it off when your loaf is done. Got this tip from [the perfect loaf](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/how-to-bake-bread-in-a-dutch-oven/).
* **Add parchment paper:** If you use parchment paper to transfer the loaf into the dutch oven, you can use a second layer of parchment paper. Make sure you trim whatever protrudes from the rim of the dutch oven -- you want a good seal on the lid to trap steam in.
* **Move to a higher rack / use baking sheet(s):** Move the dutch oven to the highest position that your oven can accommodate (farthest away from the element), and place the whole dutch oven on a baking sheet. You can insert an additional baking sheet on a rack below. I suspect using a baking *stone* (or baking *steel*) under the dutch oven would protect from direct heat even more. A stone or steel should dampen changes in temperature when the heating element starts/stops. [Covering an area with foil](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/75866/50550) would also work (I'm used to cookie sheets because I would pour water on them to steam the oven -- I find they're less trouble than foil).
* **Switch to cast iron:** If you are using a ceramic/earthware dutch oven, try switching to a cast-iron dutch oven (enameled or not). The heat retention and conductivity of metal is much higher and more heat is radiated by the sides of the dutch oven. This may seem controversial, given that so many bread cocottes are made of clay/ceramic -- but my personal experiences with my (cheap/inexpensive) clay pot is that my sourdough breads were carbonized on the bottom.


The brand of cast iron doesn't matter so much in my opinion. I've used several brands of cast iron dutch ovens (Lodge, Staub, Lagostina), all with similar results. What I've found matters most is not so much the brand, but rather how well the lid fits -- you want to trap the steam as much as possible (it keeps the loaf cooler). If your lid doesn't make good contact around the rim (e.g. if there's a wobble), you can try making a ""gasket"" with a silicone baking mat sandwiched between the lid and the pot.
* **Use finer marks on analog knobs / monitor temperature:** The temperature dial on my oven is analog and doesn't have much tactile feedback (no notches nor clicking), and there's probably a 10-15F average error when choosing a setting because of the size of the paint notches on the temperature dial. This is slightly OCD, but I line up the edges of the paint lines rather than the centers, to get a reproducible setting between bakings. An oven thermometer might be a good investment if your kitchen oven's like mine, and you need to fine tune the rheostat to recalibrate dial markings to ""real"" temperatures.
* **Adjust baking temperature / baking time:** Lastly, this is somewhat obvious, (but sometimes non-trivial depending on the recipe,) but consider reducing your baking temperature to account for any make/model discrepancies for your oven. Get an oven thermometer to monitor the real oven temperature (or even inside the dutch oven if you have a probe). Adjust the recipe time accordingly.
* **Live with it:** This is somewhat of a boring solution, but find a way to appreciate the darker/thicker crust, or scrape the burnt bits with a knife. Different unique flavors get brought out in the crust. If you find it difficult to cut through thick bottom crust with a serrated bread knife (which is personally what I dislike the most about thick crust), try slicing with a long and sharp chef knife instead, and rock back and forth on it -- i find it easier.


Something else I haven't tried yet, but could work well, is to use a thick silicone baking mat at the bottom of the dutch oven instead of parchment paper. But it might need to be cut to shape (and hence, sacrificed for that purpose) to avoid deforming the loaf as it expands -- they are far more rigid than parchment paper and don`t hug the sides of the oven as well, esp when the mat is square and the oven is round/oval. If your oven is of the ""cloche"" kind, then of course the shape/size of the mat doesn't matter as much if you can close the lid down hermetically over the (protruding) mat.

There are two main methods to create the cream, one based on condensed milk, dulce de leche or caramel, the other on butter, margarine or shortening. Often with an addition of nuts, chocolate and a dash of alcohol. Often, some raw eggs are included as well, so take the appropriate measures for these recipes.


The common trait is *low humidity* in the filling, because otherwise the wafers become soggy and - worst case - could even disintegrate. 


Recipe requests are off-topic here, but a creative use of the terms *wafer*, *cake*, *country of origin or some neighboring country*, *oblatne* or *oblate* and your preferred filling ingredients in your favourite seach engine should set you off in the right direction.

17,What is the difference between normal oils and cooking oils?,"I am not proficient in cooking but I have one question which I am not able to figure out.


I have read on internet some oils should be used for dressing, other for cooking.


But to me, they all look same. I mean what will happen I use same oil for


1. Cooking
2. Deep frying
3. Dressing


I mean, what's the difference and why is there a difference in cooking and dressing etc. in oils?


",<food-safety><oil><deep-frying><olive-oil><salad-dressing>,2013-12-15 08:09:47.293,40263,18,"There are three major properties an edible fat (I am assuming you are not asking about inedible oils like petroleum based products) has that affect how it is best used:


* Flavor
* Saturation
* Smoke point


Properties
----------


### Flavor


The flavor of the fat is very important. So called [neutral oils](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/19366/what-is-meant-by-neutral-oils) (like canola oil or refined grapeseed oil, or refined peanut oil, among many others) have very little flavor and so are suitable for almost any cooking task, as they will not interfere with or compete with the other flavors in the dish.


Other oils such as sesame oil are primarily used *for* the delicious flavor that they provide, and are almost more of a condiment than an oil for culinary purposes.


In between are oils like olive oil and coconut oil which have a distinctive flavor, but also have good qualities for cooking. Many non-oil fats used in cooking (like butter, or bacon fat, lard, or suet) also have distinctive flavors.


### Saturation


The level of [saturation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat) in the fat controls how hard the fat is at room temperature.


Most oils are fairly low in saturation, and are so quite liquid even at room temperature. The major exceptions among the vegetable based lipids are coconut oil and cocoa butter. Coconut oil is solid at room temperature, and cocoa butter is actually quite hard at room temperature.


Note that while you only asked about ""oils"", many common cooking fats not usually called an oil are much more saturated, including butter, lard, and hydrogenated vegetable oil such as the US brand Crisco.


The level of saturation can affect texture of baked goods made with a given oil, and whether the fat is suitable for the creaming method or in making laminated pastry in baking.


Saturated fats also resist rancidity better over time better than non-saturated fats (although they are still subject to rancidity).


### Smoke Point


The smoke point of a fat or oil is temperature to which it can be heated before it begins smokng.


Oils which have a high smoke point (such as grapeseed oil or peanut oil among others) are more suitable for high temperature searing, or deep frying.


Applications
------------


The oil for a given application is based on the properties it has.


### Cooking


For general cooking uses (by which I am inferring general sauteeing, shallow frying, greasing of casserole dishes, and so on is meant), normally you want a fat which is either:


* Neutral in flavor so as not to interfere with the dish. The neutral oils are all useful for this.
* Complimentary in flavor, to enhance the dish. Many cuisines have traditional fats which are flavorful, but are integrated into their cuisine, such as olive oil or butter.


Saturation matters less (as the fat can be melted before greasing a pan, for example), and smoke point is not terribly relevant unless the application is searing, in which case you want a very high smoke point.


Depending on the application and the cuisine from which a dish derives, almost any oil or fat may be used for general cooking purposes. The major exception is sesame oil, which is so flavorful that it is used as a condiment, not a fat, for culinary purposes.


### Deep Frying


The most important aspect for deep frying is smoke point. A low smoke point oil would break down and add off flavors to the dish (not to mention making the kitchen smoky and setting off smoke alarms).


Secondarily, for oils that are going to be reused over time, saturated fats such as hydrogenated vegetable shortenings break down more slowly, and may be considered advantageous.


Generally, flavorful oils are not indicated, as the same factors that give them good flavor often give them low smoke points.


Some good oils for deep frying include peanut oil, canola oil, or hydrogenated vegetable shortening.


### Dressing


For most dressings (by which I infer you mean salad dressings as used in many Western style cuisines), the most important factors are flavor and saturation.


You want an oil with good flavor (such as olive oil) or neutral flavor (such as the many neutral oils like canola, refined peanut, corn oil, and so on).


Most dressings also need an oil which is liquid at room temperature, and thus low in saturation. The major exception is the class of hot dressings made with bacon fat.


Many dressings are made from olive oil, or one of the neutral oils.


### Baking


While you did not ask about baking applications, there are two types of baking which require a fat with specific properties: cakes made by the creaming method, and laminated pastries like croissants or puff pastry.


These applications require a fat which is solid at room temperature, but still plastic enough to be manipulated. Generally, only butter and hydrogenated vegetable oil are suitable.


Bottom Line
-----------


The oil or fat you choose for any particular purpose will be based on what is best for that application—but a good neutral oil with a high smoke point such as refined peanut oil or canola oil can serve the vast majority of culinary purposes most of the time.

I assume you're using some sort of mold. If that's the case, plunge the mold into an ice bath, but don't completely submerge it. Assuming your mold is metal (molten sugar is hot!) they will cool rather rapidly although I can't give you an exact time.


In general, an ice bath is the way to go for rapid cooling. You could get it a little cooler by adding a generous dose of salt to the ice bath, but meh I think you'll only shave a few seconds.

12,How do I choose frozen fish so that it doesn't release so much water?,"I bought a package of frozen, individually wrapped, vacuum-sealed pacific cod fillets (about 150-200 grams each) from what I thought was a reputable brand (and not the lowest price) in my nearest supermarket, and attempted to pan-fry it. I defrosted it by [running cold water in the sink as advised in this answer](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/9517/20321) (it took about 15 minutes). When I opened the package, a large amount of water had separated from the fish. I carefully dried the fillet with towel paper, coated it with flour and put it in a hot pan over maximal heat [as explained in this other question](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/13077/20321). Despite my efforts and the hot pan, the fish immediately started releasing even more water, dissolving the flour and turning into a small 75-100 grams of boiled, chewy fish fillet instead of a nice fried, tender one.


So I am looking for advice on how to properly choose frozen fish in the first place. I know that it should be properly vacuum-sealed and from a reputable source (whatever that means). But even then, some frozen fishes will loose a lot of water (it was obviously the case here). What qualities should I look for when buying it? Can I tell by the fish aspect or something else if it's good or not? Are some species better than others?


",<fish><shopping><ingredient-selection><defrosting><cod>,2013-10-21 20:06:16.550,37816,12,"As far as I am aware, you cannot recognize this in advance. 


What you describe is due to very damaged cell structure in the fish. The ""water"" are the fluids contained in and around the fish cells, which make the filets juicy. They flow out when the cell walls in the fish rupture. 


The reason for rupturing is that the fluids are water-based, and water expands in the 0 to -4 Celsius range. When meat or fish is flash-frozen, it goes very quickly to under -4, and in the small time it spends in the problem range, the cell walls withstand the pressure from the expanding ice crystals. When it is frozen in a ""slow"" process, the cell walls rupture. Or, if it was flash-frozen, but sometime during storage it spend long periods above -4, it will also have this problem. 


There is no way for you to recognize whether a piece of frozen fish or meat in the supermarket was flash-frozen or not. So sorry, but you have to rely on luck, and maybe try to find if there is a correlation between certain brands and quality by buying them repeatedly.

",<eggs><boiling><soft-boiled-eggs>,2010-07-16 19:53:24.560,1199,13,"Very few people have tried a perfectly cooked soft boiled egg.

With a responsive thermometer, such an infrared one, you can approximate their work at home.


If you ever get that mad scientist feeling, try cooking the egg in a bowl of water placed in the oven. Start with cold tap water in the bowl, place the eggs in the water and the ensemble in an oven set to its lowest setting. Every five minutes, check the temperature of the water in the bowl. If you are using an infrared thermometer, stir the water before measuring. Let the water hover between 65°C to 68°C for an hour. In most ovens you will have to turn the oven off and on to keep the water in that range. The result will be a bright yellow firm gel.

15,What's the best way to get a charcoal taste on a propane grill?,"I recently was given a propane grill that is a lot nicer than my charcoal grill, however my family really likes the cooking and taste of a charcoal grill. I hear the propane grill tastes a lot different. Is there something specific I can do to get a taste similar to a charcoal grill, while using the benefits of my newer, nicer, larger, propane grill?


",<grilling><propane-grill>,2012-03-28 23:12:59.183,22631,15,"Whether or not charcoal tastes different/better is actually a bit of a debate. I've been a propane griller for years and now I use charcoal not for the taste, but because frankly, I like to play with fire. But lets assume that there is a taste difference, identify where the differences comes from, and how to address them:


1. The smoke from charcoal. This is (if you've been using natural lump charcoal) pretty much just wood smoke. If you've been using briquettes you'll also get the smoke of the filler and such, but generally this isn't desirable and we don't want to replicate it. For smoke on a gas grill - you can use something like [this smoker box](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000FJG4R4). Fill it with wood chips and place it over a burner, it should start smoking.
2. Vapor from the food drippings hitting the coals, and rising back up to flavor the food. This used to be a big advantage to charcoal, but its largely minimized by new gas grills with 'vapor bars'. As long as your grill has one of these, you're in luck. Otherwise, there's not a good, safe way to replicate it - but odds are you have it. Its a long bar usually running the length of burners.
3. Lighter fluid taste. Another undesirable flavor if you're doing a particular (and not good IMO) kind of charcoal grilling. Frankly, its not one you're likely to miss.


Those are the main tastes and how to replicate them. Nowadays the biggest is definitely #1, but it only matters if you doing foods that cook for a significant length of time or are especially 'porous'. If you're doing hot dogs and chicken breasts, I wouldn't bother if smoke. If you're doing burgers - maybe/probably. If you're doing thick steaks, thick pork chops, a whole chicken, or anything that's going on awhile, then creating some smoke is definitely worth it. (""Liquid smoke"" definitely doesn't taste like the real thing.)

5,How to get more lactic acid vs acetic acid in sourdough?,"I want to start a sourdough culture with wheat flour. I don't want the vinegar taste to be too pronounced. 


What can I do to create a culture which produces a high ratio of lactic to acetic acid? 


",<sourdough-starter>,2016-01-01 17:23:09.100,64988,10,"This is a theoretical answer based on several publications and it would require actual experimental tests. **The most probable tip seems to maintain your sourdough at 32 °C** as it will affect facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli present in your sourdough.


A lot of spread knowledge provides, without explanation, several tips such as: feed your starter more regularly, use more starter, add baking soda, use white flour, add baker's yeast, rest your dough at cooler temperature, etc.


Wikipedia [currently cites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourdough#cite_ref-d.wink_26-0) a [post](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/10375/lactic-acid-fermentation-sourdough) by Debra Wink to assert:



> 
> Conversely, a wetter and warmer starter has more bacterial activity and less yeast growth, with more lactic acid relative to acetic acid.
> 
> 
> 


Debra Wink's post is a quite detailed theory of what's going on with lactic and acetic acid productions in sourdough based on several research papers.


The temperature argument is not so clear and seems to be based on so-called **baker's rule** that low temperatures (20–26 °C) are better for yeast growth. Indeed, this paper argues that you will need a warm temperature (90 °F or 32 °C) and enough humidity as these are the optimal conditions for the growth of lactobacilli, and you need to slow the growth of yeast. While some yeast species (such as [*Candida milleri*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_milleri)) grow faster within 20–26 °C range, the optimum temperature for growth of [*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae), the species of baker's yeast, is supposed to be [30–35 °C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae#cite_ref-ReferenceA_10-0).


And more importantly, yeast does not produce acetic acid or lactic acid, it only produces ethanol (alcohol) and CO2. All acids are produced by bacteria.


Lactic acid is produced by [lactobacilli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus) and to increase the lactic acid to acetic acid ratio, it seems you will indeed need to favor lactobacilli growth, hence the temperature argument.


However, details are more complex. There are three kinds of lactobacilli:


* obligately homofermentative, producing two lactic acid molecules per 6-carbon sugars;
* obligately heterofermentative, producing one lactic acid molecule, and one ethanol molecule and one CO2 molecule per 6-carbon sugars (or just lactic acid and ethanol for lactobacilli able to ferment pentoses) ;
* facultatively heterofermentative, chosing either path depending on availability of sugars and required energy.


Facultatively heterofermentative lactobacili will apparently choose the homofermentative path (produce only lactic acid) at higher temperature.


Acetic acid is a by-product of the metabolism of heterofermentative path: whether you end up with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) or acetic acid (CH3COOH) depends on the availability of co-substrates.


Obviously, you might consider having only homofermentative lactobacilli, or facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli in a warmer environment, yet you might not be able to choose your starter with this precision in your kitchen.


Indeed, the issue seems to concern obligatively heterofermentative lactobacilli including *Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis*, which has been extensively studied as it is part of common sourdough. According to the post mentioned above, it will produce acetic acid by co-metabolizing fructose with maltose. However, Henry Ng, in a [1972 paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC380523/pdf/applmicro00047-0139.pdf) referenced by this post, found that limiting oxygen will limit the amount of acetic acid in a sourdough composed of *Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis*. In fact, this paper established *Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis* as an obligatively heterofermentative lactobacilli.


Furthermore, [according to Michael Gänzle](http://www.nyx.net/%7Edgreenw/howdolacticbacteriaaffects.html), another author being referred to, oxygen is the co-substrate for acetic acid, *Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis* will reduce fructose to mannitol, not to acetic acid, and the amount of oxygen is limited anyway (unless you shake it as Henry Ng's team did). Consequently, the production of lactic acid appears to be the principal factor of the lactic to acetic acid ratio.


Please note that this author stresses that you do need acetic acid in your sourdough:



> 
> Spicher says that a ratio of 20 acetate to 80 lactate is optimal. […] The acetic acid is furthermore important as growth of spoilage organisms such as molds or rope causing bacilli (*Bacillus subtilis*) is inhibited by high acetic acid concentrations.

2,How to make croutons crunchier throughout without burning?,"I've made homemade croutons a few times now and experimented with using more or less olive oil and cooking shorter/longer.


My first batch was the best tasting, however they were a little chewy inside, which is great if that's what you're going for, but I want them to be consistently crunchy throughout.

Basically, [Creole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole) is a much broader term with a longer history. While it is perhaps inaccurate to say [Cajun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajun) is a 'subset' area and culinary style, it is more geographically- and flavor-specific than just saying Creole. The history of people and region identified as Creole (on the American continents) goes back a long ways, and Cajun is a more recent phenomenon. Creole can also refer to other peoples and regions other than just in the South/Central parts of North America, though such use in the United States is a distant memory.


In the past century, the ""Cajun"" term has certainly attained an independent status as a self-identified people, region, and flavor -- the last no doubt owing to the flavor potency of their offerings.

1,Why did my shrimp bisque turn out so broth like?,"I made a shrimp bisque today. But it came out extremely thin like a weak broth as opposed to thick like a decent bisque should be. 


I think the problem lies here:


Now, the recipe calls for the melting of 2 tbs of butter and then the adding of 2 tbs of flour. Then the addition of 1.5 cups of hot half-and-half in a light but steady stream. However. I think I used 3 tbs of butter. 


Would this have caused it? 


I do have another suspect — the onion. 


The recipe calls for half a medium onion finely diced, sweated, and then blended to a purée. But I'm not sure what qualifies as a ""medium"" onion. I guess I should have researched that. Could the onion have been too large? 


Could the stock have resulted too much. I simmered the shrimp shells and head in 4 cups of water but I don't think that it reduced like most stocks do. If anything it reduced by a few tablespoons. 


",<soup><shrimp>,2015-12-05 09:25:45.630,64140,4,"I believe the answer to the question lies in the last paragraph of your question. If you had close to 4 cups of broth, 1 1/2 cups of half-and-half, plus onion purée (which would be mostly water); you're pushing 6 cups of liquid, not including any wine or brandy that you may have used. For that much liquid you would need close to a quarter of a cup of flour, maybe more, to achieve a thick soup if roux is your primary thickener.


Many bisque recipes are thickened much with a purée of the protein. Did you purée the shrimp or some portion of it? 


Look at this [highly rated recipe from Ina Garten](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/shrimp-bisque-recipe.html), she uses 4 3/4 cups of broth (in the final soup), 2 cups of half-and-half and a roux made with 1/4 cup (4 tbs flour). She also purées all of the shrimp, which causes a thicker soup than chunks of shrimp would, and adds tomato paste which would further thicken the soup.


For what it is worth, it is the flour in the roux that thickens liquid (an extra tablespoon of butter is not your culprit), and the liquid and roux must be brought together to a simmer for the liquid to properly thicken. In the case of Ina's recipe, she fully thickened the half-and-half before adding the stock and shrimp purée, that's how she gets away with the final line of *hot, not boiling*. I would be inclined to add the stock and the rest of the ingredients except the shrimp just after thickening the half-and-half and bring *that* to hard simmer before adding the shrimp. That would give me an opportunity to taste and gauge the thickness the soup before adding the expensive ingredient (shrimp) last.

3,Is using vinegar a viable way to reduce burning? How would it affect taste?,"In House, MD, in season six episode three the main character tags along to a cooking class with his best friend, Wilson. During the subsequent scene, they engage in a conversation which ends up distracting Wilson, causing him to begin burning his meatballs. As he notes, they're still raw inside, and he needs to continue cooking them without burning. 


To combat this, House adds vinegar with a brush, stating that it would slow the maillard reaction because of the acidity. 


Is this possible, and if so, how would it affect the flavor of the meatballs? 


",<meat><meatballs>,2015-12-05 07:46:01.827,64153,5,"The OP's answer is correct that this *theoretically* should have an effect, but I have my doubts about its practicality for a few reasons:


* The goal is supposedly to ""reduce burning,"" which implies carbonization. Carbonization happens most rapidly at higher temperatures (over 400F or so) compared to the ideal temperatures for Maillard reactions. Thus, you can very easily go quickly from underdone to burnt at very high temperatures. **Decreasing Maillard reactions is not the problem; it's too high of a temperature leading to carbonization.** *Wilson should just turn down the heat.* Increasing Maillard will just make more of a thicker ""brown crust"" giving the meatballs more of a ""fried"" texture. Most people wouldn't find that too objectionable.
* Vinegar is a rather dilute acid and is mostly water. Water will also inhibit the Maillard reactions by lowering the surface temperature of the meatballs. Effectively, before the meatballs can begin browning again, the water will mostly need to be evaporated, so the surface will ""steam"" for a bit at lower temperatures, again inhibiting browning. Anyhow, the larger problem with this from a practical standpoint is *splatter*. Introducing a bunch of mostly water onto a food right before frying will cause that water to vaporize when coming in contact with the oil and splattering. Also, the question is how much this acid will penetrate the meat surface and prevent browning vs. being effectively washed off during this vaporization and splattering. Unless you let the meatballs sit and absorb the acid for a few minutes before returning to the pan, I imagine most of the vinegar would just come off and be ineffective.
* Even presuming that the acid stays on the meatballs and that we actually want to inhibit Maillard reactions (which I'm not sure we do), I don't know how effective a little bit of surface acidity is really going to be in this case. Keep in mind that many, many people prepare meat in marinades before cooking, which often contain acidity. While most people dry the meat before cooking, this surface acidity obviously doesn't seem to get too much in the way of browning and flavor reactions, or else people wouldn't put so much acid in marinades. The uneven surface of meatballs may lead to a little more absorption of acid than a solid cut of meat, but again I have some doubts about the magnitude of the effect.


Bottom line: I suppose this might delay browning for a couple minutes, at the risk of (maybe significant) splattering. It will NOT be very effective at stopping *burning* if the oil is too hot. The flavor of the meatballs shouldn't be affected (except from the direct flavor of the vinegar), other than the outside tasting like it was browned slightly less.


As OP's link in the answer notes, there are other ways to reduce the speed of Maillard reactions, notably reducing temperature of the pan and/or removing the meatballs and letting them rest (to cool the surface down a bit while some heat migrates inward) before finishing cooking. Reducing temperature seems a much easier and more effective solution in this case. Another alternative would just be to remove them from the pan and finish cooking in a low oven: the frying is to obtain the browned outer crust, and if that's done, there's no need to keep frying.


House's solution -- while technically intriguing -- seems overly complex and unlikely to be practical, but then again, that's why people tend to watch *House*....

A tablespoon of dried oregano sounds like a lot to me, unless you really like that flavor. I would start with much less, see how you like the flavor, then add more until it is of your liking.

I don't know exactly why your pineapple didn't turn out but here are a couple notes:


1- Things that are thick or very moist take much longer than usual. 6 hours is not a long time. Obviously pineapple is both. Try letting it go overnight.


2- Really really sugary things are so hygroscopic that they have a hard time drying completely and staying dried.


3- Commercial dried fruits are usually candied and chemically altered before being dried in equipment that I can't reproduce. This shouldn't discourage you by any means but don't expect your product to always be exactly like commercial dried fruit.

5,What's the difference when smoking in a spherical grill and in a smoker?,"When smoking in a spherical grill like the Weber One-Touch, will the result be different then when a real smoker is used? What is the difference?


",<grilling><smoking>,2011-04-28 13:32:58.233,14395,6,"No, it won't be different. It is, however, a bit harder. 


The issues are mainly:


* It's harder to get the heat away from the food. So you end up cooking with some direct heat. This can be avoided by using a small amount of well soaked, large wood chunks and get them smoking with some normal charcoal. You should also use indirect heat by stacking the chunks on one side of the grill. If you use wood chips, this won't work. They burn too fast and need too much of an ignition source.
* Heat insulation isn't very good. The walls are thin and you have to remove the whole lid to tend your food. The heat dissipation can be a real issue for long low and slow recipes. Smokers either tend to be well insulated (brick or ceramic) or have small doors so you can access your food from the side.
* Adding fuel can be a pain. It's made easier if you have a grill surface that is hinged. If you don't, I'd suggest getting one if you are seriously considering smoking. It makes adding fuel much easier. Of course, adding fuel causes the above heat dissipation issues, so add fuel as infrequently as possible.


That said, I smoked for years on a Webber grill, and it worked just fine. I did, however, upgrade to a [Big Green Egg](http://www.biggreenegg.com/) at the first available opportunity. The results are more consistent and the process is much easier. But you'll be fine getting started with the webber.

3,How do I make my sorbet thicker?,"I made lemon sorbet and have already churned it but the consistency is too runny. I churned it a minimal amount using a food processor (I've done it this way before). How do I make it thicker?


",<thickening><sorbet>,2012-06-22 19:57:56.577,24642,5,"The problem could be the recipe. If you're using a lot of lemon juice, then a lot of sugar to cover up all that acidity, you're guaranteed to end up with something pretty soft. Have a look around at other lemon sorbet recipes, and see if you're using relatively more.


But if your recipe is sane, then it could be your process. Here's how it could mess things up. 


Sorbet is basically sugar water with a bit of flavor. When it freezes all the way, unless it was churned as it froze, there's going to be a tendency for it to separate into ice crystals and even stronger sugar water. Some of this may happen in your first freezing step. Then you're pulverizing it in a food processor, probably giving it a chance to melt a bit. This is much worse than just leaving it out, since once it's in tiny bits, there's a lot more surface area exposed to air, and you're continuously mixing it, bringing in warm air, and so on. Then finally, it refreezes. The part that managed to melt in the meantime is going to repeat the earlier process, except now there's lots of space, so it's even easier for ice crystals to form and force out the sugar. So I'd definitely expect a tendency to end up with a runny sugar syrup component to your ""sorbet"". (If it's at all grainy, this is probably what's happening.)


If you're determined to do this without any kind of ice cream maker, it's going to be hard to avoid problems. You can certainly try to correct for it by using less sugar, though. You could also just make a granita - freeze it on a sheet, and scrape it off to serve.

5,What is the purpose of the sugar in ketchup?,"Most ketchup recipes - [even homemade ones](http://www.ketchuprecipe.com/tomato.html) - include several tablespoons of sugar.

",<sugar><condiments><ketchup>,2012-05-11 18:38:19.127,23719,11,"High fructose corn syrup is a preservative. While sugaring your ketchup is good for flavor, HFCS is great for shelf stability, as is the vinegar. 


The reasons you typically see HFCS in American Ketchups is that it is (1) heavily subsidized and domestic and cheap, (2) farmed by the same companies making the tomatoes, and (3) a preservative. Also, it helps to improve flow while maintaining viscosity.


Sugar generally can be used to cut the acidity in a tomato dish without inhibiting the taste or outshining the tomato. My stepfather had digestion issues with high acidity meals and swore by a teaspoon or two of sugar to help aid the stomach issues. Likewise, the acidity of ketchup may well be mitigated by all the sugar.

Just make sure it's the same size pan the recipe called for, or scale the recipe to match the area - if you change the thickness, the results are going to change.


The dutch oven (uncovered) would also work, though it will take a lot longer to heat up, so it will probably affect the baking time substantially, and you may have to be careful not to overcook the top.

1,fluffiness of medu vada without baking soda,"How do we keep the medu vada batter fluffy without adding baking soda? 


I would like to use it less, hence trying to find a substitute for the ingredient, or better if the technique for cooking medu vada can be changed so that I don't need to use a substitute either.


",<indian-cuisine><deep-frying><baking-soda>,2015-11-04 06:12:33.417,63165,4,"I believe baking soda was a recent addition to medu vada and is not a required or traditional ingredient. It helps to make the vadas fluffier and it might make it easier to have a good result if your batter consistency is to not quite right, but it isn't required. Personally I find that it affects the flavor so I don't like to add it.


I think you can just leave it out entirely.


The keys to having fluffy vada without extra leavening would be oil temperature in frying and the amount of water in your vada batter. Also, whip the batter again after adding the seasonings so there is a lot of air in the batter to begin with.


The oil should be hot enough that when you drop a bit of the batter in, it immediately puffs up and floats to the top and starts cooking. If it immediately starts turning color, the oil is too hot. If it doesn't float, the oil is too cool.


If the oil is too cool, the vada will soak up a lot of oil and it will be soggy and dense and won't rise. If the oil is too hot, the outside will burn before the inside is cooked.


The batter should be almost like a very soft dough. If you hold a clump of it in your palm you should be able to hold it and not have it run out between your fingers, and it should hold the shape you give it. You should also see that it is a bit lighter and fluffier when you whip it. If it has too little water, it will tend to stay clumpy when you whip it up.


If the batter has too much water, it will not hold its shape and won't support the rising action and will be soggy. If there is not enough water it will be too dense and not rise well, so it can be hard after cooking. 


It is easier to add more water if the first one is too firm, though, so err on having too little water if you aren't sure and test the first one you make.


[Here's a recipe with a video so you can see how the proper texture looks.](http://www.manjulaskitchen.com/medu-vada/) I really like Manjula-ji's recipes and demonstrations, they are very clear and easy to follow, so hopefully this video can help with the batter.

Using flour can leave an aftertaste, especially if not fully cooked. I recommend using the more neutral starch (corn starch, potato starch) instead.


As a rule of thumb, adding starch or flour can make the cheesecake denser and more solid, leaving it out makes for a softer mouthfeel. 


Disclaimer:  

I am *not* saying that you can leave it always out, lest you come back and blame me if your cheesecake doesn't set properly. If you have a recipe that seems quite solid, you could experiment with less or no flour next time, likewise a recipe that is too runny can benefit from a tablespoon or two of starch.

Also it may look ok after a few hours but who knows how much separation is starting to happen at a very small scale and will accelerate when it hits heat.


Add the sauce at the last possible moment before plating. It isn't going to benefit from cooking, and it isn't going to marinade into the cooked food, so don't have it in any longer than it takes for it to warm up. 20 seconds is probably all it will take.

",<pizza><american-cuisine>,2010-09-01 19:47:18.440,6531,16,"**No.**


Those are not common pizza toppings in America at all.


In America there are these (rather well known) pizza styles:


**Chicago style**


Chicago style pizza is a deep-dish pizza that is baked in a *thick* heavy cornmeal based crust. The toppings are also added in reverse order of a traditional pizza. First the cheese is added, then a pound or more of sausage is added in a dense patty layer, finally it is topped with sauce. You eat it with a fork and knife. 


**New York style**


New York style pizza is wide thin-crust pizza. The crust is made with a very high gluten bread flour and hand-tossed. Some say that it gets a lot of it's flavor from the NYC water. It is typically cut into only 8 slices for a large pie. You fold the piece in half to eat.


**New Haven style**


New Haven style pizza is a bit lesser known, and originates from New Haven, Connecticut. There it is commonly called ""apizza"". It is similar to a New York style pizza in that it has a thin crust, but it is always brick oven fired until crispy. You should not be able to fold a New Haven slice of pizza in half without cracking it. It should also be crispy enough to stand up to it's own weight when held by the crust.


In a New Haven pizza a ""plain"" does not have mozzarella. A plain pizza consists solely of sauce, oregano, and a bit of parmesan and romano grated on top. Mozzarella is considered a separate topping.


They are most known for their white pizzas. These have no tomatoes at all, the ""sauce"" consists of olive oil, oregano, chopped garlic, and grated parmesan. The most well known is the clam pie which has fresh clams as a topping. It is generally frowned upon to order this with mozarella.


**Verace pizza napoletana style**


Although this is the original Neapolitan pizza, it has become very popular in the Pacific Northwest (and maybe elsewhere?). There is a [certifying organization](http://verapizzanapoletana.org/VPNAmericas_frames-index.html), which has stringent requirements for the crust ingredients, oven and so forth. The pies are very thin in the interior, with a slightly puffy edge, and are typically lightly charred in spots, which contributes a lot of flavor. Toppings tend to be minimalist.

0,How do I make the chicken absorb more salt by freezing it?,"I previously asked [How to make chicken absorb more salt when cooking a soup?](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/18889/how-to-make-chicken-absorb-more-salt-when-cooking-a-soup) on how to make the chicken in my soup absorb more salt water, as I have noticed that the amount of absorption changes in some days. Note that the recipe is simple: Add 1.5 liter water, 1 kilogram chicken, and 8 grams of salt in a pot; bring to boil; simmer and eat. There are no vegetables. 


The major reason the answerer gave was pore size influenced by freezing. Initially I thought he hit the nail, as I do recall the few days the absorption was good were the days I had taken it from the freezer.


Having been using frozen chicken since then, however, the absorption doesn't seem to be occuring while cooking. I am thinking that perhaps it is due to the way the chicken is being frozen. Factors I have thought about include:


1. If the chicken's skin isn't removed, the freezing doesn't open pores effectively. (However, I sometimes have removed the skin, then frozen the chicken; yet, this didn't help.)
2. Perhaps the duration of freezing makes the difference. (I used some old chicken, and it didn't work either.)
3. Sometimes I have cut the chicken into small pieces, where the inner parts of the chicken becomes visible; perhaps, the crystals should only form around the chicken surface, if that is where the pores are.
4. If I put the chicken in a bag, and tightened, the ice crystals do not form on the chicken hence pore sizes do not open.


Having done a fair bit of testing, I cannot seem to get these pores to open via freezing, which should then lead to high absorption of salt water when cooking. I didn't brine on the days when there was good absorption, so I think the answer has to do with freezing, although I could be wrong. 


Do you think it is an issue of freezing, and it might be something about the way I am freezing?


",<salt>,2011-11-26 20:33:49.663,19167,1,"I think your best bet is to change your recipe. While trying to figure out the exact process that sometimes makes your soup work does indeed sound like an interesting science project, it doesn't sound like its going to yield a reliable recipe. Especially since you've got to deal with supermarket chicken from suppliers that may change their processing procedures whenever it suites them—maybe even from package to package, depending on which plant it came from, or the specifics of the chickens the plant processed that day.


There are easy, reliable ways to get salt into chicken. The following two will get you salty chicken, every time you do it:


* Put your chicken (chopped up or whole) in the fridge submerged in a 13% brine for a day, and you'd at that point have chicken which would be (once cooked) inedibly salty (among other problems).
* You could chop your chicken fairly thin, and pack it (again in the fridge) in kosher salt. Then it'd become dry, and also very salty.


Of course, that'll be far more salty than you want. So you'll want to scale back—use a 5–6% brine, put it in only for a few hours, etc. But that will get flavorful chicken every time.


Then, to keep your soup base from being salty:


* rinse the brined or salted chicken before adding to the soup (to remove any salt resting on the surface)
* keep salting of the soup to a minimum.
* don't overcook the chicken, that'll force more liquid from it.
* make sure to use low-sodium chicken broth. Normal store-bought broth/stock is pretty salty.
* if too much salt leaches from the chicken, cook the chicken separately and drain it.


</rant>


edit: random suggestions since the above apparently doesn't work
----------------------------------------------------------------


* Commercially, many things are quick-frozen (e.g., fish) to *prevent* ice crystal damage. It would seem to follow then, that since you're trying to cause ice crystal damage, you want to freeze as slowly as possible. Easy way to do this would be (assuming your chicken is already under 40°F e.g., in the fridge) to insulate it before throwing it in the freezer. So, put it in a freezer bag, but then wrap the freezer bag in some kitchen towels, then toss that in the freezer.
* In previously-frozen (commercially) chicken, there may be some anti-ice-crystal additives, I have no idea. Previously-frozen isn't always sold frozen. Check the package, it should say (probably in tiny print).
* You could try a second thaw/freeze cycle (just make sure to thaw in the fridge, or in cold water, not the microwave, for food safety reasons—keep it under 40°F). This will certainly increase the effects of freezing (and would normally be avoided for flavor and texture reasons)
* This isn't freezing, but may accomplish the same goal: you could try one of the 40+-blade meat tenderizers.


Also, as a final note, it turns out that a lo of how we (humans) perceive flavor has nothing to do with the food. The ambiance, how we're feeling that day, etc. affect perceived flavor substantially. Keep this in mind, since you're not using e.g., a salinity meter, its possible you're chasing down differences that aren't due to the food itself.

0,What are the differences between slow cooking and poaching a chicken soup and how does slow cooking/poaching soup affect salt absorbtion?,"1.What is the difference between poaching and slow cooking? I believe in poaching you are meant to remove chicken 20 minutes after boiling so the meat doesn't dry out while In slow cooking I believe you leave it for longer so that the meat becomes more tender?  

Is the temperature for both between 140F-180F? 
Are there any other differences between the two when it comes to cooking soup e.g. will one give more flavour in the soup while another gives more flavour in the meat?


2.I was trying to get the chicken in my soup to absorb as much salt as possible. Somebody told me use slow cooking while somebody else said slow/fast cooking won't affect salt absorbtion. I have tried but one day noticed absorbtion and on another day didn't. it could have been due to another factor other then speed of cooking. Anyway which is correct, does slow cooking actually affect salt water absorbtion to the point that the chicken in a soup will absorb more salt? Will poaching chicken soup cause salt water absorbtion also but to a lesser extent?


",<chicken><salt><slow-cooking><poaching>,2012-02-24 22:35:36.553,21713,2,"Poaching is about cooking something gently, until just done. This is good for chicken breasts: white meat has very little fat and connective tissue, which makes it well-suited to this. It's at its most tender when it's *not* overcooked. Dark meat will be fine too. As with most other methods of cooking, it just needs to reach the appropriate temperature in the center.


Slow cooking, on the other hand, is about bringing something up to temperature and cooking it there for a long period of time. (There's no temperature to reach - it'll have been hot enough for a long while.) With meat, this is good for tougher cuts, as the long cooking helps break down connective tissue and soften it up. This is amazing for something like a pork shoulder, which can be cooked for hours and hours, until it's completely falling apart. You can probably get some fraction of that effect with dark meat. White meat will be iffy.


As for your favorite topic, salt absorption, longer cooking will get you more penetration into the meat, especially if it begins to fall apart. That won't happen easily with white meat, though, so it'll be a small effect - possibly you could cook it a while then pull it apart with a fork to help. It'll be a bit better for for dark meat.


Finally, since you've posted *so many* questions asking basically the same thing, my two cents: the best thing to do is probably just to roast chicken (don't overcook it!), shred it, and add some kind of sauce with a decent amount of salt. Cook it a little bit longer if you like, and there you are. You can only go so far with boiling/simmering/poaching/slow cooking, no matter how much you try to optimize it, and you've already gotten the main advice in other questions: possibly tenderize it, cook it in salty liquid, and perhaps help pull it apart once it's mostly cooked.

3,Why cooking times for rice are different in different locations,"When I learned to cook rice in the New Orleans area, I used the following recipe:


In a big sauce pan measure 1 cup long grain rice to two cups room temperature water, salt to taste.


Bring to a boil, turn heat down to simmer, cover with lid for 30 minutes and rice is done. Never use a spoon in rice, only a fork. This is the way I was taught and it worked perfectly every time.


I moved to Indiana and tried the same method, same rice brand, same water, approximately the same type of stove. Now I have to use more water and less cook time, about 20 minutes total, instead of 30. 


I know that Indiana is more than 700 feet above sea level, and parts of New Orleans are actually below sea level. But from what I have read, you ought to add to cook time when at a higher altitude, not subtract. 


What causes this difference? Is it really due to altitude? Perhaps relative humidity? New Orleans has a very humid climate, Indiana is usually much drier. Today for example, I checked and Indianapolis has 39% relative humidity, and New Orleans – 90%. 


Has anyone else heard of such a difference in cooking times? I would like to see if there is any kind of table giving cooking times based on local climatic differences. Please confine answers/comments to either experience or research. 


",<rice><cooking-time>,2017-05-30 18:33:36.530,82103,2,"Humidity and altitude both can have very large effects on cooking times and methods, especially with methods that are moisture-sensitive, like baking, braising, etc.


In your case, since the altitude difference is negligible, the rice is probably being affected by [the ambient humidity](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/2621/how-to-adjust-for-humidity-when-making-rice); in Indiana, the rice is in a less humid climate and will thus be drier; it will require more water than rice which is stored in a naturally wetter climate like Louisiana. The difference in cook time could be either due to a difference in your stove's efficiency in heating the water, or possibly due to drier rice being more efficient at absorbing water, I'm not sure (and can't find any real references either way).


I live in a place which is high in altitude (around 4800 feet/1460 m) and very dry (it's classified as a desert), so I have to heavily adjust any recipe involving rice, baking, etc to use more moisture and often cook longer (boiling rice I usually add about 25% more water and it takes about 25% longer, sometimes more, than the instructions specify).


Generally, if you move from one climate or elevation to a very different one, you have to experiment a little to figure out how to adjust for your specific circumstances.

You have to ask yourself what is the pattern, duration, frequency and likelihood of the outages and assess the risk before you start baking something.

",<baking><oven><pizza-stone><toaster>,2013-01-21 04:52:22.510,30268,5,"In a small toaster oven, using a pizza stone is *likely* to be a tradeoff:


* Toasting -- counter-productive, because it will shield the bottom of the bread (or other item) from the direct radiative heat from the bottom elements; you would want to remove the stone for this use.
* Broiling (or as it is called in the British parlance if I understand correctly, grilling) -- Probably not a good idea. In a full sized oven, the stone would be left far enough from the heating elements that it would not be subject to intense radiative heat. In a toaster oven, it might be too close to the elements when the oven is used this way, so might be subject to cracking due to a higher temperature gradient and uneven thermal expansion.
* General baking -- will require a longer a pre-heating period for the oven/stone to come up to temperature, but once at temperature, will provide a buffering effect for more even heating.
* Convenience -- in full sized ovens, people often leave the stone in all of the time, and cook on a different rack if they don't want direct contact with the stone. This may or may not be possible or convenient in a toaster oven, so you may be constantly removing or putting back the stone based on your current use


Note that all of the above is just reasoning based on known facts; I haven't tried a pizza stone in a toaster oven, and wouldn't do so, as they have a generally low thermal mass. I tend to think of them as tools for toasting and reheating, not for primary cooking, baking, or roasting.

It is a very poor idea to use glass cookware on a burner. Not all Pyrex is made from high quality borosilicate glass anymore, and even if you have some, the issue is thermal shock, not toxicity.


If you heat or cool glass very rapidly, the internal stress caused by thermal expansion (or contraction, when cooling) can cause it to shatter. This can be a real safety issue when it is full of hot food.


For this reason, you generally only want to use glass cookware in the oven, and never transfer it directly from the freezer to the oven, or the oven to the freezer.

7,Can I use guar and gelatine together?,"I am baking a fancy cake recipe for the first time, and have trouble with it. 


Basically, the cake has three layers. The first one is a flourless bisquit. Then there comes a guar thickened puree made of fresh mangoes and grand marnier , and above them JI am supposed to smear a thick wallop of a mascarpone-sour cream combination. 


I have all three ready (not yet combined), only the puree is quite runny. I expected it to get as hard as starch-based custard does when it cools (frankly, I have never yet tried to achieve something actually stiff with guar). But I have already put three times as much guar as the recipe called for, and it is a very viscous liquid - when you pull the spoon out of it, you see ridges which slowly run back to smoothness. It is yummy, but there is no way it will carry a thick layer of the dairy stuff (which is not quite hard itself). There is a lot of puree, about 750 ml for a 28 cm cake, so the layer is supposed to be thick. 


The best solution I can think of is to mix some gelatin into the mango stuff. But I have never used gelatin and guar together, so I am not quite sure what the result will be. First, will the taste suffer (I know that thickening agents shouldn't have an impact on taste, but I've actually had too much gelatin ruin the taste of the thing). And second, will some weird physical effect caused by the guar prevent the gelatin from setting? 


And if you have any better idea than the gelatin, I'd be happy to hear it. 


",<baking><cake><thickening><gelatin><gelling-agents>,2011-02-01 22:59:56.263,11736,6,"To me, *the* definitive guide to all these gelling agents is ""Texture"", the free e-book at [khymos.org](http://blog.khymos.org/recipe-collection/) (which I know about because of this site, by the way). It says that mango is an inhibitor to the working of gelatin, so gelatin won't help as much as you might hope. Having said that, some of the example recipes do use gelatin, so it might still help enough.


About guar gum, it says that acidity (low pH) is an inhibitor; are there any acids in your mango puree? It also says that guar gum leads to high viscosity when warm and low when colder, so cooling it down should definitely make things more solid. You could also try some of the other agents; maybe xanthan gum will help.

Evidently, the [safety warnings](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hl-vs/alt_formats/pacrb-dgapcr/pdf/iyh-vsv/food-aliment/garlic-ail-eng.pdf) specifically target storage in oil. I couldn't find a satisfactory explanation for butter not being mentioned with a preliminary search. The first Google result turns up a grossly unhelpful Yahoo! Answers page whose sources do not mention butter at all.


To the point: is garlic butter safer than garlic-in-oil, and why? Is butter not also an anaerobic environment, so that the same precautions should apply as with oil?


",<garlic><chemistry><food-safety><botulism>,2013-11-14 10:06:28.360,99732,9,"I suspected that @FuzzyChef's answer was essentially correct, but I felt that the question was not conclusively answered without sources, so I ended up never accepting an answer.

A quick Google search reveals that butter has a pH of 6.1 - 6.4, so there is indeed no reason to believe that garlic butter is safer than garlic in oil. 


As the summary says that **garlic in oil is safe for up to 4 days in the refrigerator**, it should be safe to assume that the same would hold for garlic butter.


Most interestingly, however, the document explains a method to acidify garlic for long-term storage in oil, based on research that was published a year after this question was originally posted. The method should be just as valid for garlic butter. In short:



> 
> 1. Prepare 3 parts of 3% citric acid solution (about 15 g citric acid / 500 ml water) per part of garlic to be acidified (and don't change this ratio, obviously)
> 2. Coarsely chop the garlic into pieces no longer than 6 mm (1/4 inch) in any direction
> 3. Put the garlic in the solution, mix, cover and let soak for 24 h at room temperature, then drain/sieve.

This acidified garlic is safe to use in oil (and presumably butter), according to science. Enjoy!

For less-fluffy spices like black pepper, I wold suggest a very scant measurement (that is, nearly full but dipping under the rim of the measuring spoon just a bit), or a single pinch less.


I've found the taste fairly similar to pepper - enough, at least, a recipe will not likely fail from the difference, though Jude's suggestion sounds pretty good from a flavor standpoint.

However, [Stella Parks uses aluminum foil filled with sugar](http://www.seriouseats.com/2016/10/how-to-blind-bake-a-pie-crust.html), which would have no ventability at all.

Thanks


",<chicken><salt><brining><kosher>,2011-12-09 20:33:34.637,19552,5,"I explained several of the differences in my answer to [Brining a kosher bird](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/19142/41) and also discussed some issues relating to salt consistency in a much earlier answer to [Chicken comes out salty... occasionally](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/12683/41).


To make a long story short, kashering is a long process with many steps, but the part you're concerned with is similar to the ""dry brining"" technique some people are fond of using for Thanksgiving turkeys. The meat is salted directly - no water is used - and it is left to rest for a much shorter period, about 1 hour, before finally being rinsed and packed.


Kosher meat isn't ""juicy"" like brined meat at all; in fact, all other things being equal, it will come out much drier and tougher than unkosher meat, because in the process of drawing out blood (the reason for salting in kashering), a good deal of moisture is drawn out as well. Brining adds moisture to the tune of about 10%; kashering takes moisture away by a similar amount.


Aside from drying out, the only culinary differences you'll find with kosher birds (or other meat) are (a) less blood, uric acid, and other ""undesirable"" components, and (b) they are naturally saltier than unkosher birds. However, because the kashering process has nothing to do with flavouring, you can't expect any kind of consistency, and it's not uncommon to find that some parts are much saltier than other parts coming from the *same bird*.


Kosher birds are going to absorb roughly the same amount of salt and water from a brine. The difference is that because they've already been salted, you run the risk of over-brining to the point of being inedibly salty. That's the whole story.


If you want flavourful *and* moist then get a regular bird and brine it. If you care more about flavour and want to save some time (at a significant cost premium) then go ahead and use a kosher bird, no brine. You *can* brine a kosher bird (see first link in this answer) but you're going to have to do a little experimenting to get it right - and if you're going to brine anyway, then why bother spending the extra money on kosher meat?


Don't pay any mind to the oft-repeated claims that kosher birds are ""pre-brined"" or similar nonsense. The inherent saltiness of a kosher bird is significant but also incidental and thus inherently unreliable.


(Please also note: Assuming this is a follow-up to your previous question, *none of this is going to make the slightest bit of difference if you're just going to plop the chicken parts into a pot of boiling or poaching water.* If you're making broth, then you flavour the broth, not the meat.)

The main point where prepping what reads like two servings (""every morning"" & ""26-28 hours) might come handy, is when you have an uneven number of bananas per serving and storing half a banana is kind of impractical.


Have you considered freezing your fruit? In pieces, so that one banana is cut in an even number of pieces (& can thus be easily divided). Then when it's time to blend your breakfast drink, just add as many pieces of frozen banana as your recipe requires. No need to thaw the fruit, any reasonably strong blender should be able to deal with it. 


This would allow you to


* prepare the fruit for multiple servings at once
* eliminate the question of keeping the fruit fresh
* give you bananas that are always just the ripeness you prefer
* lets you make good use of bananas on sale




---


If still want to go the bananas-in-milk route, it's essential that you refrigerate the whole thing: letting your *milk* stand at room temperature is not safe. That said, you can even refrigerate bananas that are already blended in milk for a day or two. Food-safety-wise totally fine and while you might see some browning, it's mainly about eye-appeal. So you could blend a two-day ration of bananas in milk.  

If your drink contains more ingredients that can't be pre-blended, pour off and refrigerate half of the banana-milkshake, add the daily serving of the other ingredients and whizz to blend for a moment.

20,(Intentionally) Mixed Texture 'Scrambled Eggs',"I'm trying to replicate a strange form of 'scrambled eggs' that I had on holiday in Austria recently, but I can't figure out how it's done.


Instead of the usual fluffy, semi-soft yellow 'clouds', all roughly the same texture, this was a mix of different textures/types: part slightly runny omelette, part firmer omelette, part hard boiled egg including the whites. I thought the omelette parts and the boiled egg parts must have been cooked separately then assembled at the end, but the finished article was all joined/melded together rather than being in separate pieces.


I've tried making the different components separately then combining, but it doesn't all come together right at the end. I've also tried poaching the eggs, then putting them in a frying pan, bursting the yolks and letting the liquid form the omelette, but again that doesn't come out right. 
PS: Two points to add:


1) I had this several times while on holiday and it was always the same, so I presume it was intentional and not a 'one off' mistake by the chef.


2) I know it probably seems like more trouble than it's worth, but I really enjoyed the mix of textures rather than the usual homogenous variety, so it's not about replicating it for the challenge. I really want to keep eating this!


Does anyone have any ideas please?
Thanks in advance.


",<omelette><hard-boiled-eggs><scrambled-eggs>,2017-04-05 14:36:07.880,79668,25,"That's the method of scrambeled eggs I learned when I was a kid. It's extremely simple and needs a certain sloppiness to get the - in this case desired - results. No beating the eggs in a bowl, no super-diligent stirring and no milk or cream added.


Tools:  

A pan, a fork or small spatula. 


Ingredients:  

Eggs, butter, salt, (pepper).


Method:  

Heat some butter in the pan on medium heat - probably hotter, than you would for classic scrambeled eggs. Once pan is nice and hot, crack your eggs *directly into the pan*. Wait a moment until some of the whites have started to set - if you make four or more eggs, this will have happened already by the time you added the last one. Use your fork or spatula to loosen the bits of egg that have started to set at the edge and bottom of the pan and push them to the middle. Be gentle, do not actively ""scramble"" the eggs or stir too much. Continue, until the eggs are mostly done, then give them a last good stir and serve. 
You can also stop stirring a tad earlier, lower the heat and put a lid on the pan to finish cooking, which will give you a more omelette-like appearance as the loose lumps bind together.


That should result in streaks or strands of yolk and whites (like hard-boiled egg) in a pale yellow scrambeled base.


If you've been dilligently making smooth scrambeled eggs in the past, it may feel like ""messing up"", but it works.

9,What temperature are dark beers (stouts and nut browns) supposed to be consumed at?,"I remember reading somewhere that certain beers are supposed to be drunk much closer to room temperature than most people drink them for optimal flavor. Specifically stout beers and nut brown ales are only supposed to be ""slightly chilled"". I think I read that the temperature for optimal flavor is around 55 ℉ (13 ℃). However, most people I've met are shocked when I tell them this and swear by a nice cold one. My own personal experience does seem to confirm the ""slightly chilled"". Am I crazy? 


",<temperature><beer>,2010-08-30 12:06:41.583,6354,10,"No, you're not crazy. You have good taste. The reason for drinking darker beer like stouts and porters is for the flavor. If they are over-chilled, you lose most of that flavor. Don't obsess over it, but in general a lot of people serve dark beer too cold.


That said, you should drink your beer at whatever temperature makes you happy. There is nothing wrong with a nice cold pilsner or Hefe-wizen on a hot day.

7,How can I preserve soy sauce eggs?,"My favorite restaurant has an appetizer (or banchan) that my friends and I all adore. They're eggs that have been soaked in some kind of soy sauce brine and quartered.


Back when I was just learning how to cook, and regularly made terrible, terrible decisions, I came up with ""Osaka eggs,"" in that restaurant's honor. (I still make terrible decisions, actually, but now with *confidence*.) My Osaka eggs are boiled for as long as possible in a salty soy sauce broth. Since it takes some time, I usually make a big batch, and occasionally I lose a jar in the back of the fridge, and a month later they've gone lacto on me. Probably safe, but I'm not a fan.


As a result, I've been considering the possibility of canning them. But I don't have a pressure canner. So I looked into hot water bath canning, and... you're only supposed to do that with sugary or acidic preserves. I'm not interested in introducing any more sugar or acid to my eggs.


So, my question comes down to what can I (or must I) do to preserve my Osaka eggs without introducing a bunch of sugar or acid? Use more soy sauce? Could I strain/reduce the braising liquid and have high enough salt content to make the hot water bath safe? 


Or, counter-intuitively, should I not heat the soy sauce at all? I know vegetables are preserved, via fermentation, in miso and doenjang. What about soy sauce? Because with the long braising time, my soy sauce brine is pasteurized.... So, could I actually make my eggs last longer by simply leaving the soy sauce uncooked? (And cooking everything else in some lightly salted water, just so we're clear.)


\*\*Here's the basic recipe I multiply for making terrible Osaka eggs so you can see the relative concentration (or lack thereof) of salt.


(...And a warning that you might not want to try these at home, kids. One person thought they were tea eggs, got all excited, and ended up running outside to spit it out. They taste like ...something that should be meat but isn't meat and some people become confused and even distraught by the cognitive dissonance they create. But I love them and want them to last, dang it.)


* 2 cups of water
* 1/2 cup of soy sauce.I like Lee Kum Kee's double-fermented. Sometimes
I'll add some dark soy sauce or mushroom-flavored for part of it.
* 1/8 cup fish sauce
* 1 T oyster sauce
* Some kind of spices: cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, star anise, black
pepper, fennel, allspice, cloves, coriander.... Whatever makes you
happy.
* .....
* A sliced red onion
* A sliced shallot,
* Some rough-chopped garlic, you measure with your heart,
* A hot pepper,
* 7 or 8 dried anchovies, heads and guts removed.


The first block of ingredients go in a pot, preferably of the crock variety. The other stuff goes in a dry saute pan and are accordingly sauted before being added to the pot. If anything's stuck to the saute pan, splash a little more water in to clean it and add that to the pot. Then add a bunch of boiled and peeled eggs, and let it go however long you want. My friends and I will let them go for a full day or three, and the mushy braised vegetables (and anchovies) are a nice bonus topping for rice.


",<eggs><food-preservation><soy-sauce>,2020-01-04 02:16:04.440,104529,3,"You could ferment your eggs; [salt-pickled fermented eggs](https://www.fermentingforfoodies.com/salt-brined-fermented-eggs/) are a thing and don't require any higher salt content than you already have. However, there are some potential problems with that.


First, your comment that ""a month later they've gone lacto on me. Probably safe, but I'm not a fan"" gives the impression that you wouldn't like the result of fermentation. Second, a couple of your ingredients -- the oyster sauce and the anchovies -- are easy-spoiling ingredients that could cause the batch to go off.


Your brine doesn't seem quite high enough in salt for canning them to succeed. [You can hot water bath brined eggs](https://survivingshtfmom.com/2015/06/11/how-to-can-hard-boiled-eggs-and-pickled-eggs-easy/), but only if they are brined in a very high salt solution -- the linked post says 25% brine. Heck, [with enough salt you can keep eggs for months without canning at all](https://thewoksoflife.com/salted-duck-eggs/). But that's a lot more salt than you're using.


While you can theoretically pressure-can boiled eggs without salt or acid at all, [after an hour of cooking under pressure they would not be edible](https://www.backyardchickens.com/threads/has-anyone-ever-canned-eggs-update-i-opened-a-jar.425930/).


Overall, I don't believe there's any way to preserve them that wouldn't substantially alter their flavor/texture. So ... I'd say make as many as you'll enjoy in a few weeks.

2,When is the best time to freeze bread?,"We have a small household and most baked goods are not finished before they go stale. 


For bread and buns, when is the best time to freeze?


After knead? 


Before first proof?


After proof?


After second proof?


",<bread><freezing><food-preservation>,2020-01-11 03:20:18.497,104685,5,"In the book *Advanced Bread and Pastry*, Michael Suas outlines three methods that he recommends to professional bakers (but also applicable at home) for freezing bread at various stages, roughly in decreasing order of quality:


* **Par-baked process.** The bread or rolls are prepared normally and baked normally, but for a shorter amount of time (just until the structure is set). For best results, Suas recommends a relatively high temperature at first to maximize oven spring, then decrease to a much lower oven for the rest of the baking time. 
Bread should be pulled from the oven before most substantial browning, with just the basic structure intact so the bread doesn't collapse. Loaves or rolls are cooled to about room temperature and then frozen quickly. They may then be removed directly from the freezer and baked immediately, usually at a relatively high temperature. The biggest challenge for a home baker here is potential moisture loss and slight staling during cooling and freezing (as commercial bakeries tend to use a blast chiller). But if done well, the results are basically the same as normally baked bread.
* **Frozen dough process.** The dough is mixed/kneaded, divided, shaped, and frozen immediately to minimize fermentation and gas activity. Generally the only modifications are to use cold ingredients and to mix/knead more thoroughly, as the lack of a shaping step after defrosting means that the the gluten must be thoroughly developed during the initial mix. High-gluten flour or added gluten may also help with the final rise. (Gas production and fermentation is then limited to avoid more damage to the gluten structure during the freezing process. 
It also makes it easier to wrap the dough tightly without much dough expansion during the freezing process.) When frozen dough is to be held longer, a higher yeast content may be used as the yeast activity will gradually die off with prolonged freezing. The best thawing method is slow and in the fridge. This also allows the possibility of reshaping (if necessary) before the final proof at room temperature. Final quality is usually okay but lower than parbaked results, either due to insufficient yeast activity/dough structure after freezing or excessive ""yeasty"" flavor if more yeast is added to the inital mix offset this. This method is usually best for enriched doughs that can distract from the lack of good flavor development.
* **Preproof frozen process.** Here the dough is mixed in the usual fashion, then shaped and allowed to undergo a single proof to about 75% of the usual final size. The dough is quickly frozen. It can then be removed from the freezer and placed directly in the oven to complete its rise and bake. This process is the most temperamental and least likely to produce bread of high quality. Suas only recommends this method be used for things like breakfast pastries with a high butter content -- to distract from poor flavor development and texture -- that will be consumed relatively quickly after baking. But it is very convenient to get a warm ""fresh-baked"" product quickly with little effort at the end. Still, Suas strongly recommends par-baking over this process for most baked goods. (And the frozen dough process at least allows the possibility for reshaping and controlling the final rise to get a better product.)


I've tried the first two processes myself at times, and they've both produced reasonably good results. Like the information I summarized above, I wouldn't recommend letting the dough rise before freezing though, unless you're going to parbake. More gas bubbles mean more ice crystals that will potentially damage the bread structure during freezing. 


Other answers and comments have mentioned the possibility of doing a complete normal bake and freezing the final loaf. That's also a reasonable possibility, but if I'm to that stage and I know I'm going to freeze some bread, I often pull out some of the loaves a few minutes early, so I can defrost/finish baking them in the oven. 


The one concern to that is that parbaked bread (in my experience) tends to stale a little faster after it is defrosted and baked, partly due to moisture loss during two stages of baking and two stages of cooling. If you don't plan on eating most of the bread right away after baking, I'd probably tend to either freeze fully baked bread (and defrost at room temperature), though the ""frozen dough"" method may be acceptable for richer bread doughs or doughs that don't depend on a high rise (e.g., pizza). The choice of method really depends on how much work you want to do at various stages, the type of dough/bread, and how quickly you plan to eat the finished bread.

1,How much pepper sauce could you get out of a Carolina Reaper?,"If you can get one pepper and let's say for arguments sake assume that this pepper is 1 500 000 SHU. How much sauce could you actually make from one such pepper?


I would personally remove the seeds to improve my seed bank. How would this influence the amount of sauce you could make?It would have to be a reasonably strong sauce, but not overbearing.


Is there a general rule of thumb for how pepper sauces are made in regards to the SHU levels they achieve?


",<sauce><chili-peppers>,2016-08-10 17:38:24.067,73057,3,"Pepper sauces usually deliver an aroma (from the peppers), some sweet/sour/salty element (from the pickling ingredients mostly), and heat (from the peppers). A hotter pepper will not necessarily be stronger in aroma, so using this kind of super hot pepper alone can end you up with a sauce that is hot but poor in flavor. Also, given that capsaicin is very soluble in fat but not very soluble in water/vinegar, such a sauce will have a very uneven distribution of heat and will likely end up with a very harsh, unpleasant heat no matter how diluted - similar to throwing chile powder into a lean soup.

5,Thawed shrimp floating vs. sinking,"I bought two 2-pound bags of frozen 41-50 count/pound shrimp. When I thawed them in cold water, one bag's shrimp all sank and the other bag's shrimp all floated.



```
           Bag 1          Bag 2
buoyancy   sink           float
color      more white     slightly brownish
rinsing    clear          frothy
marking    66H/15TT/976   668/21TT/0H354

```

I assume one of them is not nearly so fresh as the other, or possibly has been frozen and thawed multiple times. I did some searching but couldn't find any real help.


Assuming that one is not so fresh, I would like to return it to the store. But which one? I'm guessing the floating and darker color indicate a more advanced state of decomposition, but your input is appreciated. I'd like to have ammunition at the store in case they question me.


",<shrimp>,2011-07-31 07:19:43.237,16552,1,"According to [this study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-4530.1994.tb00331.x/abstract), frozen seafood has a density ranging from 972 to 1017 kg/m3. Thawed, raw seafood at 20°C has a density ranging from 1042 to 1093 kg/m3. Since the density of water at room temperature [is about 998 kg/m3](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=density%20of%20water%20at%2020C), it is certainly possible—and most likely normal—for one batch of frozen seafood to float while another sinks. Thawed seafood that has been brought to room temperature, on the other hand, should almost always sink since its minimum density (1042 kg/m3) is higher than water's. Therefore, I would only worry if the shrimp continue to float after they have been thawed. If they are shell-on, there is a chance that there could be air stuck between the shell and the body, though, which would of course be perfectly fine yet affect the density/floating.


**Edit**: What are the ingredients listed on the bags? Very often nowadays salt and salt-based preservatives are added to frozen shrimp in order to retard water loss. It could be the case that one bag has preservatives while the other does not. This could of course affect buoyancy by changing the density of the shrimp. (In general, one should try and only buy individually quick-frozen shrimp where ""shrimp"" is the only ingredient.)

0,Are cooked frozen shrimp safe?,"I was buying some frozen shrimp, however they listed that they are cooked.


How is the process of freezing shrimp done; do they cook them directly then freeze them? Or freeze them then cook them then re-freeze them?


Are they safe to be eaten? Or do they contain bacteria (in large amounts)? 


Then, if they were cooked, what am I supposed to do, fry them a little?


",<shrimp><food-safety><frozen>,2013-01-17 12:42:34.167,30160,5,"The frozen pre-cooked shrimp are of course safe to eat if they come from a reputable source.


You may wish to cook them a little bit to heat them up to service temperature, and integrate them with a sauce or spices or so on, but you could just peel and eat them if you wanted to.


The shrimping industry may have some variation in how it processes shrimp after they are caught. There are certainly some vessels that are capable of cooking their fresh caught catch on board; there are also some shrimpers, especially in waters near the US, which can freeze the shrimp on board. Hopefully someone more directly familiar with the shrimping industry can give you a better answer on this part of your question.


Even if the shrimp were caught, frozen on board, then cooked at a processing plant and refrozen, assuming that the various parties took good and reasonable care, they could still be of high quality and of course safe.


All of the above assumes you are buying shrimp from repuatable and licensed sources in your own jurisdiction.

8,Is it good to store a salt block with silica packs?,"We recently started using an Himalayan salt block. We cleaned it as per the directions, and the storage said to scrub it, dry it, let it air dry, and store it in an airtight container.


It seems clear that these storage directions are intended to make sure we keep the block as dry as possible. I thought it would be even better to toss a silica pack or two into the airtight container, since silica packs help keep whatever is in their container dry. The instructions certainly don't suggest doing this, presumably because silica packs aren't common items to keep around. (If it matters, I scavenged this one from a bag of jerky we had eaten.)


Is there anything wrong with this idea? My understanding was that the silica packs keep their silica all inside the packet, and draw the moisture into the packet, and that it shouldn't interact with the salt block at all, but there's a fine line between food chemistry and magic for me.


Should I toss a silica packet in to the container that has my salt block?


",<storage-method><salt>,2019-02-02 17:20:35.023,99286,2,"Depending on your climates humidity, if its too humid salt works like a big silica pack. It absorbs moisture, and you might get liquid salt runnoff. If you live in Denver Colorado, you could probably store it on your porch.


General suggestions are to wrap salt blocks in plastic wrapping.


Therefore if you double up that with an airtight container you can store it indefinitely.


Silica gel is also a form of porous sand that stores moisture and does not harm your salt block in any way. The two compounds are also separated by the silica gel packet wrapping.

0,How dangerous is mold at the bottom of container with fat,"My friends from a farm gave me some clarified butter, about half a liter in a plastic container.

Obviously, this means that butter was not clarified properly and some non-fat components remained at the bottom.


What should I do with the butter? Is it unsafe? Or I am ok to use it if I don't touch a bottom level? Can I transfer untouched butter to another container? 


",<food-safety><butter><mold>,2019-04-15 13:39:21.933,97491,3,"I would toss it. The only thing where it's generally considered safe to eat around the mold is hard cheeses.

17,Does squid ink pasta bleed?,"Will the black color from squid ink spaghetti bleed onto other ingredients?


I was recently given a package of squid ink spaghetti. I haven't used it before and I want to try something creative.


I was thinking of separately cooking some regular spaghetti and mixing the white and black together after they are cooked separately. This won't look good if the black bleeds onto the white. It would just turn everything gray.


",<pasta><color><squid>,2019-06-20 17:16:35.430,99649,26,"No, as far as I know pasta made with squid ink, often called *nero di seppia*, should be stable, and the ink doesn't normally bleed into the water.


From my experience after boiling black pasta, even the fresh kind, the water comes out clear like with regular one, with just a bit of clear starch being left behind.


If you boil regular and black pasta mixed together the white pasta should not get significantly tainted with black color, just like when you boil *tricolore* type of colored pasta (those multi colored green, red and white mixes) the colors don't bleed.


You can (faintly) see [in this cooking video](https://youtu.be/A7iOBZZfsrA?t=678) that both the boiling water and the rinse water are not darkened.


Black ink also doesn't bleed into sauces after boiling, so you can use light colored sauces without negatively affecting it's appearance, nor does it stain containers like white ceramic of dishes or bowls.


Only situation where you should get bleeding black is for dishes where the squid ink is added to the pasta after boiling, either while stirring in the sauce or along with other ingredients, rather than being mixed into the flour.

5,Is there a compressed gas device designed specifically for creating infusions?,"[This answer about creating infusions](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/24431/14563) suggests using a compressed gas siphon to quickly infuse liquids with flavours from 'fragile' herbs. 


[The manufacturer of the popular iSi compressed gas siphons](http://www.isisnorthamerica.com) seems to sell [whipped cream](http://www.isinorthamerica.com/consumer/products/easy-whip/en/) and [soda siphons](http://www.isinorthamerica.com/consumer/products/soda-siphon/en/), but neither is advertised for the aforementioned infusion purpose. I'm not at all averse to using one of these devices for this different purpose from that which it was designed, but I'd like to find the most usable device for creating infusions using compressed gas.


This leaves me with the following questions:


1. Is there a compressed gas device designed specifically for creating infusions using [this method](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/24431/14563)?
2. In general, would a soda siphon or a whipped cream siphon be more suited to creating infusions?
3. Are there particular attributes to look for in a compressed gas siphon that lend themselves to creating infusions?


",<equipment><gas><infusion>,2013-01-14 03:22:39.023,30062,5,"1) I do not think so, the technique was described in e.g. modernist cuisine, they suggest using a ISI siphone and if I can remember correctly does not describe any other tool.

1,Why do my shallots keep turning blue?,"Title sums it up, every now and then I'll notice that shallots sometimes take on a pronounced blue (or purple) tinge after cooking. I've noticed it when they're sauteed or roasted, seemingly independent of other ingredients. I'm aware of a similar, more common phenomenon with garlic, but that involves some source of acidity and copper, which hasn't always been present (eg. just shallots and olive oil in a nonstick pan). As such, I'm assuming there's another cause at work.


",<color><shallots>,2018-02-14 20:13:54.703,87763,2,"Vegetables with a naturally blueish-red color - red cabbage, beets, red onions, shallots, blueberries, red grapes (wine too) - usually have that color due to anthocyanin content.


Anthocyanin behaves like litmus paper, and takes on a different hue depending on pH value. If food containing it turns blue, it is too alkaline - and might also be at less than optimal flavor because of that. Add acidity to make it red.


Specifically with shallots, though, do make sure that it is not actually blueish mold getting washed into the cooking liquid. Unpalatable at any pH.

5,How do you get the flavor out of dried peppers?,"A recipe calls for dry chili peppers for my Moroccan fish. I know sweating fresh chili peppers will release the flavor, but how do you release the flavor of dry spices like dried chili peppers?


",<flavor><spices><chili-peppers><sauteing>,2016-01-29 09:03:27.383,66018,5,"In some recipes (eg chinese kung bao, some thai and south indian soups), you score the peppers or cut them into coarse pieces, so cooking oil or a broth with some fat or alcohol content can enter and exit the inside while the peppers are sauteed/stir fired with the rest of the food. This tends to dissolve a lot of heat into the liquids without too strong a pepper aroma.


In others (a lot of thai and goan recipes), the peppers are mashed, sometimes with other spices and aromatics, in a mortar and pestle.


In both cases, you have to decide whether to soak the peppers in very warm but not boiling water beforehand. Also, you can shake the seeds out or leave them in. Look at specific recipes for guidance there.


Oh, and a warning: sauteing dried chili can liberate a surprising amount of capsaicin into the air - if you are dealing with, say, a dozen dried thai chili, it can happen that you find yourself coughing violently in a corner. Ventilate well, and if you feel like you are getting overwhelmed, make sure the kitchen is safe and grab some fresh air ASAP.


Oh... and if you are going the first route, it is inadvisable to put any other ingredient in the dish that has the same color as the dried chili. They won't be THAT hot anymore when cooked out, but still not exactly mild, AND many varieties are texturally and flavour-wise unpleasant if accidentally eaten whole.

6,How to rise and bake a sourdough loaf in the least amount of time?,"Sometimes I need to bake a loaf or loaves of bread as soon as possible with my sourdough starter. For example my few tablespoons of starter needs to become bread within the next three hours when dinner is served. I'm happy to enrich it with sugar, salt, fat, eggs, etc as required, so a really developed sourdough flavour (while fine) is not necessary. I would still like most of the other aspects of good sourdough, such as enough gluten development to hold a nice airy rise.


In other words, I am not interested in cultivating the lactic acid bacteria in the sourdough, only the yeast, but without negatively affecting other characteristics of the loaf.


Assuming I always start with a few tablespoons of starter, what methods and conditions would I set up to increase the yeast/CO2 production in the least possible time?


My thoughts so far relate partly to bread in general and partly to just sourdough:


* maintain a firmer, more frequently fed starter?
* drier dough hydration to reduce baking time and possibly kneading time to allow more rise time? (would this have other effects?)
* rise at a very warm temperature - 25 degrees celsius? (but would this accelerate acid production and gluten breakdown too?)
* add salt last?
* add fats last?
* several brief kneads during the first rise?
* longer final rise after shaping?
* bake from a cold oven instead of a preheated one to allow a slightly underproofed loaf to rise as much as possible before gluten structure sets? (what other effects would I anticipate?)
* shape baguettes or rolls instead of loaves to reduce baking time and allow more rise time?


",<bread><dough><sourdough>,2014-01-14 22:07:49.620,61602,3,"Shorten the intervals for feeding, prove in a warm environment, use a high LA starter to begin with, (mine started life as a mix of live yoghurt, wheat flour& an apple from my garden).

5,How to stir fry frozen veggies?,"There are various frozen veggie mixes available in my local grocery shops, that are meant to be used in stir fries (according to their description at least), but I can't seem to get satisfactory result out of them. Whenever I try to stir fry them, two things happen:


1. Wok's temperature drops due to the ice-cold veggies being put inside.
2. As veggies defrost while I cook them, they release a lot of extra water.


And I get mushy veggies as a result. As if I were making a stew or something.


So is there a trick to it? Should I defrost everything and drain the liquid before frying? Instruction on the bag says, that I should put veggies on the pan in frozen state. Any idea why?


Or maybe it is the quality of product that matters?


Any advice is welcome.


P.S. I have a regular stove at my place and a small sized wok. Nothing fancy or military-grade.


",<vegetables><frozen><defrosting><stir-fry>,2017-04-17 11:17:07.467,81000,7,"The trick is to not use a wok at all. A wok works by concentrating a lot of heat on the bottom, more heat than you can achieve with a home stove. ""Stir frying"" moves the food from the cool sides of the wok, through the intense heat at the bottom, then out.


Rather, use a wide skillet. A home stove can't generate the intense, focused heat of a restaurant stove, but it can generate a lot of heat over a wider area. Put your skillet on the burner, add some oil, get it good and hot, then add your vegetables. The intense heat will defrost them and cook them quickly.


You have to work in smallish batches, probably no more than half a bag. And if you want to stir-fry meat with the vegetables, you may need to temporarily transfer the one out to make room for the other.


As for defrosting... the idea is that you don't need to: thinly sliced vegetables will quickly go from frozen to thawed to cooked when given direct access to very hot oil, and all surface moisture will quickly evaporate. Defrosting them will just give them time to get mushy. 


I'll be honest, I'm not entirely convinced that that's better than defrosting them and allowing the water to drain. But I have observed that when these vegetables come out of the bag, they look nice and clear and perky, and when they're defrosted they look kinda sad. So, maybe there's something to it.


Anyway, that's my advice: use a wide pan, over high heat, with a fair bit of oil, and work in small batches.

1,Substituting cayenne for red pepper flakes,"My wife does not like alternating textures, or ""surprises"" in sauces. Thus I need to make certain concessions when cooking for her.


She does not like crushed red pepper flakes, but will readily take cayenne in its place.


My question is: can this substitution be made in any situation? I will make it when I am flavoring my own dishes. But I have a new one I'd like to try, and I am not sure if I can do it.


I am going to make Bourbon Chicken, which calls for the pepper flakes. The flakes would be sauteing / reducing in the sauce. I've read this might be a situation where the substitution would not work.


Just wanted to hear what fellow chefs did.


",<substitutions><spices>,2015-04-12 22:59:21.350,56652,2,"Crushed red pepper flakes and cayenne come from the same types of peppers, and you can definitely substitute one for the other in terms of spiciness (most resources I've found say that you add about 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne for every 3/4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes, or vice versa).


However, beyond the spiciness level they may not give the same flavor to the dish. In the particular recipe that you're citing, since it calls for sauteing the flakes some of the spiciness will be drawn out of the flakes and carried with the sauce, while some of it would stay with the flakes and provide those bursts of heat that your wife doesn't seem to like. As Willem says, you can use fresh chile peppers, add them like you would the flakes, and then take them out before serving. That is probably the closest you can get to the same flavor without having those ""surprise spicy"" moments. (1 red chile per 3/4 teaspoon flakes).


Adding ground cayenne pepper towards the end of the sauce would allow the sauce to have a pretty uniform spiciness, without any surprises, but may not give it the same flavor. Cayenne pepper is usually just the ground up cayenne pepper (a specific variety). Red pepper flakes may consist of a couple different types of dried red peppers, and they often include the dried up seeds in addition to the the dried peppers themselves. So, the cayenne will add the spice, but probably not the same complexity.


My suggestion: Make half the sauce with cayenne and half with red pepper flakes and see what you think!

1,Stir fry sauce quantity,"I am trying to create written instructions for making stir fry for some rather inexperienced cooks to follow. One dilemma that I'm having is describing the amount of sauce to use. How would you quantify the best ratio of sauce to vegetables? For instance, how many cups of sauce to coat 10lbs of vegetables?


If we were going to keep the sauce to reuse at a later date, I would just make a big batch and then having the cooks use their judgement on how much to use. We can't really keep the sauce, however, and I'm not sure I necessarily trust the cooks' judgement either (sadly!)


",<sauce><asian-cuisine><measurements><stir-fry>,2011-07-27 01:59:13.167,16434,4,"The ""best"" ratio of sauce depends on:


1. The type of vegetables;
2. The type of sauce;
3. The quantity of solid food;
4. Time spent cooking;
5. Personal preference.


I've made some stir fries with no sauce at all (technically a stir-fry only needs oil) and some with extra sauce, particularly if they're intended to be eaten with bland white rice. I know you say you can't trust their judgment, but to some degree, you're really going to have to, because there are too many variables to pin it down to a golden ratio.


At the end of the day you're trying to get an even coat on the vegetables (or meat, or whatever) - the thickness of that is again dependent on personal preference. But even if you make that decision for them, the main ratio affecting the end result isn't based on the weight of the food, or even its volume - it's based on surface area, which is nigh on impossible to measure and guaranteed to be inconsistent between specific preparations.


Stir-fry sauce is extremely cheap to make. It's pennies per cup. If you make too much, you can always cook it down, so if you have to pick a number, it's better to err on the side of caution and make too much as opposed to too little. You can always supplement the real sauce with soy sauce, teriyaki, etc., but that's not the same as a proper stir-fry sauce thickened with tapioca and flavoured with sesame oil and so on.


So pick a number that seems a little high, and instruct the cooks to let it reduce if it seems watery. They'll be using high heat, so it won't take long to reduce, and the net effect is positive anyway (a stickier, more flavourful sauce).


Personally, I always find 1 generous cup of sauce to be more than enough for a standard-size (14"") wok filled with meat and vegetables, assuming it's the kind of stir-fry that you want to be reasonably ""saucy"", and also assuming it is thickened properly; if you dump a full cup of pure soy sauce in there, you'll just end up with vegetable soup. I literally use a coffee mug and never measure any of the ingredients, and the difference between one preparation and the next isn't particularly noticeable.


So start with that as a guideline and test the recipe yourself, if you can. Unless you have extremely precise control over the quantity *and* quality of the raw ingredients in addition to a precise and well-tested sauce recipe, you won't be able to come up with a reliable ratio. It's not a question of trust, just practicality; Asian cooking is (at least in my experience) very loosey-goosey and doesn't lend itself well to precise recipes - or inexperienced cooks.

22,Pizza baking order,"First few times I thought it was coincidence but now I'm puzzled. I'm baking two pizzas, one after another, made from the same dough and with the same ingredients.

I have two pans and I tried them in a different order, same result. Only difference is that the second pizza gets 15 minutes more dough raising, but raising 3 hours or 3 hours and 15 minutes shouldn't make such a difference.


Any idea what is happening?


",<baking><pizza><crust>,2010-09-01 17:19:56.253,6524,25,"I think it might be the humidity inside the oven that's making the difference. After cooking one pizza, the oven is filled with the steam given off by the cooking dough, sauce, etc.


The humid air in your oven is probably heating the pizza up faster and more evenly (which is what you want for pizza). 


Try putting a pan of hot water in your oven for a few minutes before you cook the first pizza and see if that makes the difference.

2,How to broil a rack of goat ribs,"It's football playoff time, and I have two racks of goat ribs. My cooking plan is to wrap the ribs in foil and broil them. Any recommendations about what to do with them first, and what to put in the foil with them?


",<ribs><broiling><goat>,2011-01-05 21:27:44.863,10797,7,"I am assuming that you have actual goat ribs, like pork ribs, and not a rack of goat chops. I had a full goat breast that I just cooked them the other day. If you just broil them as you describe they will be tasty...and tough...and greasy.


You want to treat these like pork ribs, needing a slow cook. I first smoke my ribs, then braise them, then finish them under the broiler with a thinned sauce. [Here's the whole process in great detail at cookloose.com](http://cookloose.com/index.php/Recipes/BarbecueRibs)


Unless you are saying broil as a means of describing putting them on a grill, note that wrapping the ribs in foil before broiling defeats the purpose. Broiling is directional heat...heatfrom a direction. Wrapping them in foil reflects the direct heat away.


However, your method is, almost, correct. You DO want to wrap the ribs in foil with a little liquid (beer?), maybe some garlic and a bay leaf, or do a full rub, and then put them in the oven at low heat for a braise. This will cause the meat and connective tissue to get soft and yummy. THEN pour off the liquid, open the foil and slip under the broiler to give them a crusty finish. Brush with a sauce or not, as you wish.


So...slow cook in liquid...broil to finish, but not wrapped in foil for the broil.

edit: I tasted some after writing this and it seems that they are getting crunchier as they get cooler as well even without salting


",<salt><legumes>,2019-05-03 06:14:50.357,98790,15,"Frozen peas don't really need 'cooking' at all.  

The smaller they are the less they need, too; so anything labelled 'garden peas' or 'petit pois' really all you should do is drop them into boiling water, stir & give them maybe 1 minute maximum to heat. Drain & serve immediately.  

Don't wait for the water to return to the boil, assuming you have maybe twice the volume of water as peas, just keeping the heat under them for a minute will be sufficient. 


They will keep cooking as long as they remain hot, which is possibly why you thought adding the salt afterwards was the trigger. It wasn't, it was that they will simply keep cooking; so the trick is to drain them early rather than late.  

I usually drop them as I'm serving the rest of the meal, so they're not waiting around at all, they're just the last thing onto the plate. If I'm adding to something like risotto, I will add right as I'm going to serve. Drop, stir, serve. They'll finish cooking on the way to the table.


If you leave them too long - 2 or 3 minutes is all you've got, maximum - then they will just get harder & harder over time. There's no rescue at this point, they're ruined. Switching off the gas isn't sufficient to stop them over-cooking, you need to get them out of the hot water straight away.


If you want them salted, salt the water first; though I never salt peas, they don't really need it. I do salt almost all other veg, just not peas.


The same, incidentally, applies to sweet corn. On the cob, 6 mins max; as individual kernels, drop them in boiling water, stir, done.

9,Can you freeze jalapenos?,"It's getting colder outside and I have a lot of jalapenos in my garden. I like eating them fresh (not cooked) on homemade tacos and omelets, etc.


If I freeze them and thaw them out later in the winter, will they still be as spicy and crunchy, or does the freezing and thawing take some flavor away from them?


",<freezing>,2011-09-26 23:07:57.267,18027,13,"I have a whole freezer full of jalapenos - so yes, you definitely can.


They definitely retain their heat just fine. 


They keep their texture better if you do 2 things:


* Use a vacuum sealer and take out all the air - to reduce freezer burn. Because of this, I recommend you freeze them in batches.
* Blanche them for 2-3 minutes in boiling water and then drop them in freezing water. From what I've read, this destroys a particular enzyme that helps *not* break the pepper down further. I've done this and not done this - and doing it *definitely* helps on the texture.


They should be good for a little over a year in a vacuum sealed bag - as far as the texture goes. They should never *go bad* otherwise.


Cos and Sobachatina - bring up another good point: freezing fast and effectively. You can try AB's method that Cos points out, but I do what Sobachatina does. Freeze on a single layer on a tray in the freezer. They freeze quicker and better than dumping them in a bag.

8,How is white pizza sauce made?,"As far as I know, the only difference between white pizza and red pizza is the sauce. 


I know that the white sauce is dairy-based, but what is it exactly? What are the main ingredients, is it thickened somehow? Is there something special to pay attention to when making white sauce? How thick should it be exactly? Should it contain herbs or not? Oil? How does it combine with the cheese, is the cheese supposed to melt ""into"" it?

[![Side on - showing some 'bits' not on the surface](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7YgsTm.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7YgsT.jpg)


I recently discovered an ancient, sealed jar of Nutella at the back of a cupboard. Like, really ancient! Like, it claimed it *expired* in 2012!


When I open it, there are all these white 'bits' on the surface.


They don't at ALL look like mold or fungus - they're definitely not spores, to my eyes. My first thought is that they're ""granules"" of fat that have ""condensed"" together in some manner? Perhaps kinda like bloom on chocolate?


Does anyone have a better or more certain answer?


Obvious follow up... do the white bits indicate that it's unsafe to eat?


The expiry date doesn't concern me at all - if it looked fine and tasted fine then I'd eat it; if it were clearly moldy, then I might scrape the moldy layer off, microwave it and eat it.

7,Adjusting cookie recipes for high altitude,"When baking cakes, I often find that there are instructions for high altitude, which usually is just a matter of adding some extra flour.


I understand the concept of high altitudes having less atmospheric pressure, which then allows baked goods to rise more easily (too much), and thus the addition of flour.


However such alterations are not often provided with cookie recipes. What is a good way to know how to adjust cookies for high altitude, or if such an adjustment is even necessary?

It appears that the answer depends a little on the type of cookie. If you have a cookie that has a great deal of air in it you'll have the same problem as cakes do. If you are working with a very dense cookie that can't really fall (since there isn't anywhere to go). At that point you're just down to watching baking times and temperatures, which are easier to monitor.

4,Can I substitute gluten for eggs in coconut flour pancake recipes?,"I'm looking to reduce carbs, yet still have things like pancakes, waffles, and maybe even tortillas.


I've tried several coconut flour pancake recipes, but they all come out tasting like fried eggs to me.


I was thinking I could probably add vital wheat gluten in place of the eggs, but I'm not certain this would work. What amount of it to use per egg in the recipe?


",<substitutions><eggs><flour><low-carb><vital-wheat-gluten>,2017-01-21 13:51:58.483,98916,7,"The primary reason coconut flour recipes (especially a high hydration recipe like pancakes) end up tasting like eggs is because they *are* primarily eggs with very little flour.


Coconut flour is extremely absorbent, which means two things:


1. For the same amount of liquid, you need less coconut flour compared to other flours like flaxseed meal, almond flour, etc. Because you must use less of it, there is less flour ""flavor"" that comes through to the final product, if that makes sense.
2. For the same amount of coconut flour compared to other flours, you need more liquid. Because coconut flour has very little protein compared to other flours, that liquid tends to be eggs, which have the necessary protein to provide structure.


Take a muffin recipe for example (I've omitted all other ingredients besides flour and eggs for sake of clarity).


Flaxseed meal version:


* ¼ cup flaxseed meal (28 g)
* 1 jumbo egg (63 g)


Coconut flour version:


* 2 Tbsp coconut flour (14 g)
* 1 ½ jumbo eggs (95 g)


Now let's look at the baker's percentages of eggs to flour in both of these recipes. In the flaxseed meal version, we see that the weight of the egg is 225% compared to the flour (if the flour were considered 100%). In the coconut flour version, the weight of the eggs are 642% compared to the flour.


Something that uses 642% eggs is likely going to taste a lot like eggs. But wait, we're not done yet. Most pancakes recipes are simply flat griddle-cooked muffins, though they tend to have even more liquid than regular muffins. That likely means even more eggs, and egg ratios upwards of 800-900%. At those levels, it's more like an omelette with the coconut flour just going along for the ride.


Whether you can substitute vital wheat gluten (VWG) in place of eggs is really going to depend on the rest of the recipe. Without knowing what the other ingredients are, it's hard to make suggestions. If eggs are the only ingredient providing moisture, then substituting with VWG alone won't work without also adding a source of moisture. ~~My gut feeling is that VWG would tend to exacerbate the requirement for moisture (it's also very thirsty), and tend to make leathery pancakes~~. Actually, I suppose it might theoretically be possible to replace the function of an egg by combining a small amount of vital wheat gluten (say, 6 g) with a non-egg source of liquid like buttermilk (say, 45 g). I'll have to try experimenting with that and report back. Until then, this is how I approached solving the ""eggyness"" problem:


**EDIT:** since posting this, I've developed a coconut-flour version of my low-carb `Buttermilk Pancakes #12` recipe, which I'll include here. While I know this isn't a recipe exchange site, I think this recipe can help show how I approached solving the OP's original problem of too much ""eggyness"":


Buttermilk Pancakes #12 (Coconut Flour + Whey Protein Isolate)
--------------------------------------------------------------



```
3 ½ Tbsp coconut flour (*flour*)                          42.98%  24.5 g
1 Tbsp psyllium husk powder (*flour*)                     14.91%   8.5 g 
¼ cup, packed, unflavored whey protein isolate (*flour*)  42.11%  24.0 g

¼ tsp baking powder                                        2.02%   1.2 g
1/16 tsp baking soda                                       0.51%   0.3 g
1 Tbsp Splenda (non-nutritive sweetener)                   2.96%   1.7 g
3/8 tsp Kosher salt                                        1.84%   1.0 g

1 jumbo egg                                              110.53%  63.0 g
1 cup buttermilk                                         429.82% 245.0 g
1 Tbsp unsalted butter                                    24.86%  14.2 g

```

A couple of things I'll note. First, this recipe has around 475% hydration, so it's still quite high, but it solves the eggyness problem by using only 1 egg. To make up for the structure and liquid that the egg would normally provide, I replaced it with several ingredients which work together to function like an egg. First is the unflavored whey protein powder. When mixed with the buttermilk and cooked, it will set up similar to how an egg might set up. However, being a pure protein powder, it is an extreme ""drier"" (similar to egg whites), and would produce an inedible dense pancake by itself. To balance that out, I added a moisture retainer in the form of ground psyllium husk. The psyllium husk also acts like a binder and holds everything together similar to how an egg might. The end result is probably the equivalent to around 3 eggs or so without tasting like an egg.


P.S. I originally posted this recipe along with 3 other low-carb flour variations over on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/bujew4/buttermilk_pancakes_12/).


Regarding the carbs in buttermilk (and yogurt): While the nutrition info for 1 cup (245 g) of buttermilk and 1 cup (245 g) of whole plain (unsweetened) yogurt will say around 12 g of carbs from sugars, in reality, that number is actually much lower. The reason for this is that most of the milk sugar (lactose) in buttermilk and yogurt has been converted by the bacteria culture to lactic acid. As doctors Jack Goldberg and Karen O'Mara explain in their book ""The GO-Diet"", you can count a cup of either of these as 4 g of net carbs rather than 12 g.

5,How can I make an Überfood?,"Each day, you're supposed to get a certain number of servings of grains, vegetables, fats, etc. You know, the food pyramid.

What I'm describing is an Überfood, as it has a near-perfect balance of all of the daily intake requirements. They make it for cats, dogs, and other mammals, so I'm sure it's possible for us primates. Like cats and dogs, I'd of course have the occasional treat, but it would always be above-and-beyond and not part of my daily nutrients.


What considerations should I put into making an Überfood? Ideally, it would be shelf-stable and not need refridgeration. Texture and taste are less important.

3,What is the relationship between starchy vegetables/fruits and root vegetables?,"I am battling with rosacea and was recommended by a doctor to not eat starchy things, including starchy vegetables and fruits. I know that starchy vegetables include: corn, potatoes, yams, etc.


So...I was at a restaurant the other night and I was talking to the waiter about vegetables/fruits, and I was telling him that I cannot eat starchy things. He replied, 'okay i'll remove the root vegetables/fruits' from your plate. And this totally threw me for a loop.


I dont understand if there is a relationship between root vegetables and them being starchy. I can't seem to find the answer online so I thought I would ask here.


",<vegetables><starch>,2014-02-02 16:22:29.077,41692,6,"There is a mid-strong correlation between starchy vegetables and root vegetables, but not a perfect one. 


![relationship diagram](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bv6Kz.png)


Plants have many types of roots. Some of them are thin and fine, others are large. Their primary purpose is to extract nutrients and water from the soil and pass it up to the rest of the plant, but some plant families have started using their roots (and underground parts of the stem, which non-botanists mistakenly call ""roots"") for storage purposes. This is why some plants have rhizomes, tubers and bulbs. 


Starch is a very efficient way to store energy in a small volume and without much risk of spoilage, so many plants employ it for that purpose. (The other efficient carbohydrate-based storage molecule class is the sugars). So underground storage organs frequently contain high levels of starch, for example potatoes and yams. 


Over the centuries, humans have selected food based on mainly calorie density, taste, and obtainability. Starchy roots are better than many other roots for both calorie density (explained above) and obtainability (it is easier to pull 100 clean gram of potato out of the earth than 100 g of dainty clover roots, for example). **So many of the roots humans eat are, in fact, starchy**. But we also eat other roots. Onion bulbs contain stored energy primarily as sugars, not as starch. Other roots like radishes are much less calorie dense (their main macronutrient is still starch, but they have little macronutrients per unit of weight when compared to e.g. potatoes), but they are eaten for their strong, pleasant taste, and still easy obtainability. 


But a root is not the only place where a plant can store energy, and different plants employ other places. The fruit is a very common place. And while some plants store mainly sugars there, other store mainly starches. Botanical fruits (some of which are called ""vegetables"" in the kitchen) are eaten frequently, and are a major source of starch in the diet. Peas, pumpkins, chestnuts and plantains are all examples for high-starch fruit vegetables. Other fruit vegetables are like the radish - there is not much starch stored in them, but even less of everything else, so they are still considered high in starch. An example would be tomatoes. So, **there are many non-root vegetables which are high in starch**. 


You may want to note that starch needs to be cooked, while sugars don't. So, if you have a dish of *cooked* root vegetables, most of them will be high in starch. Assuming that the waiter wasn't bringing you a salad, it was probably a good decision to take out all root vegetables. 


But it isn't a good decision to stop at the root vegetables, because there are non-root vegetables high in starch. It could be that the waiter didn't know that, or that he knew it, but also knew that this specific dish doesn't contain any non-root starchy vegetables. Whatever it was, you are better off by memorizing a list of the vegetables you can't eat, than by trying to follow generalizations of the kind ""don't eat root vegetables"".

6,What to do with crumbled muffins?,"I made some muffins that apparently didn't have enough liquid to stick together (perhaps substituting Greek yogurt for sour cream was not such a good idea, as that, butter, and an egg contributed the only liquid). So the muffins crumbled completely on leaving the greased tin. Are there any culinary uses for them, or am I stuck trying to eat the big chunks and throw the rest out? They are so crumbly that packing them to the office for breakfast like I usually do won't work.


The specific ones I made are cinnamon coffee cake flavored, but I'd be curious about the general case.


",<culinary-uses><muffins><quickbread>,2012-02-25 16:31:12.620,21796,5,"Since it sounds like they are basically a dried out batter at this point, I would turn to implementations that rely on those kind of food-stuffs;


* With some further baking and possibly additional brown sugar and butter or apple-sauce, I would use them for a crumble topping. If they are coffee and cinnamon an apple-cardamom cobbler would benefit nicely.
* The crumbles could be incorporated into a biscuit batter recipe
* In all likelihood, any kind of recipe that relies on a granola could probably be referenced for further ideas.
* You could also use the crumble as a stand-in for oat based no-bakes. The no-bakes might feel mealy to the tooth, so not entirely eliminating the oat might work best.


If you wanted to repurpose, you might try thinking of it as a material to be suspended. With an ingredient like well-blended coconut butter (not to be confused with coconut oil or milk or cream) you could create a base with which to make a kind of post-raw bar cookie (basically press and chill the coconut butter in a pan on top of wax/parchment paper, pulse the muffin bits with some dates or brown rice syrup, and once the butter sets press the bits/dates mixture into the top and drizzle with some ganache or whatever).

0,Gritty White Chocolate,"I'm making white chocolate following [this recipe](http://www.cupcakeproject.com/2011/07/how-to-make-white-chocolate-in-less.html) and it had a couple issues:


* The sugar didn't fully dissolve, so some of it tasted overly sweet at the bottom of the mold, rest was basically cocoa butter
* It had an extremely strong and awful alcohol-y after taste. I used Bourbon Vanilla extract and Liquid almond extract


I tried again later with using granulated sugar and it also didn't dissolve, remaining quite gritty. Is there some secret (or obvious) step I'm missing to help the sugar dissolve?


Also, is using alcohol based extracts in chocolate a no-go? Cause that after taste was positively awful. Multiple recipes online don't seem to say anything against using alcohol extracts though.


Couple final notes:


* I used both a double boiler and microwave melting for chocolate
* I used the vegan version of the recipe (soy milk powder)


",<chocolate>,2018-03-28 17:20:27.240,88714,4,"1/3c Sugar is never going to dissolve in the ~one tsp liquid from the extracts, and sugar simply does not dissolve in fats - so your cocoa butter won't dissolve it either. 


This is a known problem in chocolate making, both white and not... commercially sugar and/or milk powder is mixed in by a process known as conching, where the sugar is mixed into the chocolate by grinding, often for days, to the result is smooth to the tongue. Many ""homemade"" confections either start with premade chocolate, or add liquid to dissolve the sugar... which ends up making a fudgelike confection (you have to add other ingredients to prevent the chocolate from seizing, and end with the confection not only softer but with other flavors), some try using butter for its water content. 


If the cocoa butter is just melted to or cooled to sludgy, before adding the sugar, the powdered sugar might be folded rather than mixed in and the result cool quickly enough not to settle. It still may have texture issues, though.


As for the alcohol-based aftertaste, it may be the extracts were too much for the amount of chocolate, or that your particular extracts had a heavier alcoholic taste. I believe extracts intended for candy making are different from those intended for baking, for this reason among others - they have less liquid, they are rated to higher temperatures, they balanced differently since they are less likely to be mixed into larger volumes to dilute tastes.


Many recipes start with chocolate melting discs, etc, for this reason. If you really want to make your own, or you want a flavor profile with a higher % cocoa butter and/or less sugar, you might have some success with adding cocoa butter, milk powder, and flavorings to lesser amounts of white chocolate (essentially, you'd just be using it for the amt sugar needed for the larger batch, the cocoa butter and milk powder already there would be ""extras"").

3,How to cook chicken cutlets in a cast-iron skillet,"We want to cook healthy chicken cutlets and were wondering if the best is to use our cast-iron pan rather than a regular pan.


Any advice on best practices for chicken cutlets cooked in cast-iron? Cooking time? Heat level?


We want to avoid the breaded version so we keep it even healthier.


",<chicken><cast-iron><skillet>,2013-11-14 18:32:39.130,39450,5,"Chicken breasts do not require extremely high heat, nor strong searing (in fact, they are quite easy to overcook), so while a cast iron pan is certainly effective, it is not required. Any quality pan will do.


If you are sauteing simple chicken breasts (perhaps lightly marinated or seasoned), the technique is quite simple.


Often, you are better off pan-roasting as follows:


1. Preheat your pan for about 5 minutes over medium high flames (or burner setting if you are electric), and oil it lightly.
2. Put the chicken breasts in, and leave undisturbed at medium heat until they are lightly browned on one side and released from the pan, 4-5 minutes.
3. Flip the breasts over and again, leave undisturbed until lightly browned.
4. If not done, place in a moderate (350 F, 180 C) oven until done, probably 5-10 minutes, depending on the thickness of your breasts.


You will know they are done when they register 160 - 170 F (depending on your preference; I like the lower end of the range) on a high quality instant read thermometer. You will also learn to know when they are done based on the texture an how much resistance they have to being poked.
5. Once they are done, remove them from the pan and let them rest a minute or two.
6. During this time, you may optionally return the pan to the stove top and create a pan sauce of your choice.


While a little more work, pounding the with meat mallet (I don't own one, so I use an 8 inch skillet as a mallet) to an even thickness of no more than a little less than an inch (2 cm) will help them cook quickly and evenly.


Note: if you have true cutlets (which are about 1/4 inch thick, less than a CM), you will need to raise the heat slightly, and only cook for 2-3 minutes. The oven phase is unlikely to be necessary. Otherwise, the technique is the same.

",<salt><indian-cuisine><curry><kosher-salt>,2013-12-19 13:12:22.343,40400,6,"You can use Kosher salt or sea salt or even table salt but keep in mind that they are interchangeable by weight NOT volume. Volumetric measurements fail because of different sizes and shapes of salt crystals. Kosher salt crystals are, as you pointed out, larger and end up with larger gaps between the crystals when measured by volume than the smaller table salt crystals that settle together more closely (consider the tiny spaces between grains of sands versus the larger spaces between pieces of gravel). This means that a teaspoon of table salt actually contains more salt than a teaspoon of kosher salt. This means that if your recipe calls for a teaspoon of table salt you will need to use more than a teaspoon of kosher salt. They will dissolve equally well. As to when to add salt, add minimally at first then adjust the salt to taste at the end.

3,How to cook cubed fish for a fish taco (tortilla),"Today someone at work described eating a delicious halibut taco. I've never had one before but it sounds awesome, so I'm going to try to make one some time this week (but since I have a lot of salmon in stock, I'm going to make it with salmon instead of halibut). I'd rather not grind the fish - ground fish does not sound like something that's too interesting to eat. So, I was thinking I'll just cut the fish into cubes, and fry them up, then throw the cooked cubes into a tortilla, roll up with some sauce, and serve (to myself). If it turns out good it would be a great recipe to share with friends and family.


However this is not something I've done before. I know fish breaks apart quite easily when cut into small bits, so is it even possible to preserve ""fish-cubes"" in a frying pan or will all the little cubes break into a flaky mess? Or, maybe it would be better to cook the whole fish first and then dice it afterwards?

Unless *solid* silver, most within the last 100+ years made in the US, UK and Germany will likely be some mixture of copper / nickel / tin. Some might have *pewter* detail and decoration which *might* contain lead, but typically not on the tines / blade / etc. Pewter as a base for silver-plating saw its real beginning after [antimony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimony) was predominately used to make it, but you can only really guess unless the company is still around and confirms it, or you have it tested. Most which is still in use today would likely be made of a nickel alloy under the plating. 


If you're at all in doubt, or get an odd taste, you can send them out to a plating shop, or just polish and display them and get something you know to be safe. Odd metal 'tangy' tastes are *probably* coming not from lead, but copper in the alloy, but always go on the safe side here. 


You can, as folks noted in comments, have them tested. However, unless you're really keen on their continued use due to monetary or sentimental value, the cost / reward ratio could get lopsided quickly. 


If they have a maker's mark (or other markings), you might be able to get some more information from an antique dealer, which could at least get you an appraisal in addition to knowing more about their makeup.

4,Why did my idli looked cooked from outside but was still mushy inside?,"I sometimes try using Homemade batter for making `idlis and dosas` as I live in the perfect temperate climate which is required for fermenting the batter properly and wish to cut down on the preservatives which are found in ready to use batter packets.


Usually it comes nice and fluffy, sometimes a little hard due to more `urad` in it. But this time when I thought the batter was all perfect, my idlis totally disappointed me. In the steamer it looked as if it had cooked perfectly although it did not rise much, but to my disbelief when I removed it from the steamer's plate, and opened it up it was uncooked inside.


Can anyone suggest what am I doing wrong here? I ferment the batter overnight. Is it less? Will it not become rotten if I keep it outside for 24 hours? I know its like a rocket science which either one gets it or not, but I am looking for a `desi` method here which will not disappoint me everytime!


P.S. I just realised that I also changed my steaming process. Do you think that could have changed something?


Earlier I was using a pot like this over the flame:

You imply you are an experienced idli and dosa maker, so you will have to experiment with fermentation and cooking times. If they did not rise, it would suggest you are not fermenting long enough. And denser batter will take longer to cook. You already have a genuine desi (Indian) recipe and methodology, you just need to tweak it to your local conditions.

17,How do I make my chocolate brownies 'fudgy'?,"What are the key requirements, in terms of both ingredients and techniques, for baking chocolate brownies with a fudgy centre?


",<baking><chocolate><brownies>,2012-02-07 19:29:04.453,21135,17,"Every time I make brownies, I always get compliments on how fudgy they are. There may be some variations based on the recipe you use, but the three things I've found to be most important in my experience are:


1. **Don't even think about using a boxed/pre-made mix!** Bake from scratch - it adds a whole 3-5 minutes of extra prep time for brownies, but the taste and texture would be worth it even if it added an hour.
2. **Use fewer eggs.** I use the King Arthur Flour ""Grandmother's brownies"" recipe; I can only find an online copy for the 200th Anniversary edition, but those instructions aren't the same as the older version my mom's cookbook has. The recipe calls for 2-4 eggs per batch (a batch is a 9x9"" square pan), and instructs you to use more eggs for a cakier brownie, fewer for a fudgier one. I've found that 3 eggs works best for me.
3. **Use brown sugar for at least some of the total sugar in the recipe.** The King Arthur Flour recipe calls for 2 cups of sugar, either white or brown. I typically split 50/50; the brown sugar adds a nice flavor, and I think the moisture in it helps achieve that fudgy consistency, too.


There's another element to changing the consistency, too: **cooking time**. Most brownie recipes I've seen say to bake for 35-45 minutes; I almost never bake them for more than 30 because I find that the edges start to get really dried out. Undercooking slightly will keep the brownies moist and fudgy.


 The ingredients from the old ""Grandmother's Brownies"" King Arthur Flour recipe: 4 ounces (squares) unsweetened chocolate [can substitute 1-ounce square = 3 tbs cocoa powder + 1 tbs butter); ½ cup (1 stick) butter; 2 cups sugar and/or brown sugar; 2 to 4 eggs; ½ teaspoon salt; 2 teaspoons vanilla; 1 cup flour

0,Can cooking or processing generate more natural sugars?,"This question excludes all added or synthetic sugars (which I abbreviate to AS), and refers only to only natural sugars intrinsic and inherent in food (which I abbreviate to NS). 


I wish to clarify [the following helpful comment](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/64918/if-you-must-not-eat-added-sugar-with-what-can-you-top-your-pancakes-or-waffles?noredirect=1#comment97517_64918) in response to my (now closed) question on suggestion for toppings on pancakes and waffles without any added or synthetic sugars, because my grandmother's dentist and physician oppose her consumption of any AS:



> 
> Besides whole fruit, you can also use something like apple sauce. Apple butter and appelstroop are technically apple, but cooked down so that the sugars are concentrated and would likely violate the 'added sugar' exemption. And there are jams that are made with only fruit (eg. Polaner All Fruit), but again, it's concentrated.
> 
> 
> 


Does 'concentrated' here mean that:


1. cooking and processing generate new sugars, so that the comestible's initial quantity of NS < the comestible's final quantity of NS.
2. or cooking and processing only condense (ie: increase the density of) the existing NS, so that the total quantity of NS remains the same before and after (but not the total density)?


If the answer is 1, then my grandmother cannot use such products;  

but if the answer is 2, then please allow me to pose another question on the healthiness of such products for my grandmother. 


",<sugar>,2015-12-30 16:40:16.970,64927,0,"The comment you cite obviously means the second explanation. The total quantity of sugars within the apple is not considered to increase in apple sauce making. Its density, however, does increase. And the increase can be substantial, as fruit is mostly water. In fact, ""table sugar"" is nothing but processed (concentrated) beets or cane. 


It is possible that some production processes will create new sugars, usually by enzymatic splitting of longer carbohydrates. This is where the fructose in high fructose corn syrup comes from. So you can't assume that the second meaning will be true for all cases where you start with a fruit or vegetable. It is just true for traditional applesauce recipes. 


Whether it is possible to make jam ""without added sugar"" is a very murky question, as ""added sugar"" is not really definable in this case. 


As for the healthiness of such products, this is both off topic and unanswerable. You should ask your grandmother's doctor. He's the only one who knows what he meant and intended when he prescribed the diet.

4,How to use gelatin on fruit pie?,"I feel very stupid for asking this, but I've never worked with gelatin.
I know how to work with powder or sheets, if you put it in something like panna cotta.
I also know there's an issue with gelatin and temperature.


But I want to put gelatin on top of my banana pie, like the professional ones. So I have the bottom, which is the dough, then the cream and then some slices bananas. I would like some gelatin on those bananas.
Should I bake the pie first and afterwards, put some gelatin on it?
Or put gelatin on it and bake then?


And does it make a difference here if I use powdered or sheet gelatin?


",<baking><fruit><pie><gelatin>,2011-04-14 09:46:36.047,14030,4,"It makes no difference whether you use sheet or powdered. Just make sure to use the right amount. It should be given on the package, like ""this sachet is enough for 500 ml liquid"". You can try to use less than indicated for a softer texture, but if you don't use enough, it will stay liquid, so you may need to experiment until you get it right. 


You can't bake gelatin. It is a protein and denaturates at 50°C. The proper way is to bake your pie or fruit cake as always, and after it is ready, pour the gelatin containing liquid over the fruits and wait for it to congeal. (I am assuming here that you just want a gelatin glaze over a complete pie. If you want a complete gelatinized filling, everything below applies. Bake a shell, put the fruit in it, then fill it with the liquid). 


The liquid itself can be pure water, or water syrup, or, if you used canned fruit, you can catch the liquid from the can and strain it. Then use it, pure or diluted with water. Sugar of food coloring don't interfere with gelatin, use them as you see fit (I think it's popular to color the gelatin on strawberry cakes a light red). 


The mixing is very similar to panna cotta. First, bloom your gelatin by putting it into a cup with some water (1-2 tbsp) and leaving it for awhile. It should soak up the water, use it while it still looks moist, before the granules stick to each other. It usually takes around 5 minutes. Meanwhile, warm your liquid on a very low setting. It is best to use a thermometer. Dump the gelatine into the liquid while still on the heat. Stir until dissolved completely, never let it get too warm. When dissolved, remove from the heat and pour immediately. 


There aren't many things which interfere with gelatin, but some fruits (or the enzymes in them) do. These tend to be tropical fruits with at least moderate acidity, like papaya, mango, kiwi and pineapple. If you pour gelatine on them when they are raw, it will have trouble setting. Cooking them should help, but I don't know how long or what temperature. If they are canned, it should be OK. Bananas are not a problem, even when raw. 


And because you said you want to make it ""professional"": If you are talking about a thin glaze, gelatin is not your only choice. You can use starch as a thickener, many professional bakeries do so. It eliminates the possibility of getting the right texture of the glaze (which will be rubbery with too much gelatine and half liquid if you don't use enough), and maybe you'll feel more comfortable with it.

55,Should I rinse canned beans before using them?,"Certainly, if I were making a salad with canned beans, I would thoroughly rinse them first. But if I'm making soup or chili with canned black beans or kidney beans, should I drain and rinse them first? Goya brand beans have recipes on the side of the can that call for undrained beans. 


On the one hand, I've heard claims that using the liquid in the can will increase gassiness, and that in some brands it can contain a lot of sodium. But I've also heard that it contains lots of soluble fiber that is lost if drained. Is there merit to either of these claims? Are there other nutrients that get lost if I drain and rinse? I always feel bad throwing out anything edible.


",<mexican-cuisine><beans><budget-cooking>,2011-02-07 23:51:35.147,12160,54,"I finally found what I'm looking for, from the [University of Michigan](http://med.umich.edu/umim/food-pyramid/legs.htm) - some actual data on the subject!


They say that rinsing canned beans can reduce the amount of sodium by half, and also reduces the amount of complex sugars which humans can't digest (but the bacteria in our intestines can, with uncomfortable results!)


It appears that draining the fluid is likely to improve the flavor and texture of the resulting food by concentrating the flavor of the beans -- unless you're following a soup recipe that specifically suggests retaining the liquid to thicken the soup.


I still haven't found any information about what healthy nutrients might be lost by rinsing the beans, but the general consensus seems to be that it rinsing will do more good than harm in almost all cases.

2,Scotch oats to substitute Fine Oats in Rum Balls,"I have a recipe for Rum Balls that calls for ""Fine Oats.""

I had not heard of fine oats before - probably because they're typically marketed more as a nutritional supplement than a cooking ingredient.


According to [The Protein Works](https://www.theproteinworks.com/thelockerroom/what-are-fine-oats/),



> 
> Fine Oats are a low Glycaemic Index (GI) carbohydrate that are considered ideal for providing a slow sustained release of energy for an athletes...fine oats are easily added to protein shakes...many sports nutritionists use them in various recipes such as nutritious homemade bars or cakes.
> 
> 
> 


Two things in that description make me think that Scotch oats won't be a perfect substitute. First, Scotch oats could probably not be added to a protein shake without being cooked first. Second, I don't believe oats are typically considered to have a low Glycemic Index value. The Mayo clinic lists them as a ""Medium GI"" food: [Glycemic index diet: What's behind the claims](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/glycemic-index-diet/art-20048478)


I don't know if something is done to fine oats to change their nutritional properties, or if this is just a disagreement about Glycemic Index labeling.


If you're not concerned about the Glycemic Index value of your rum balls (and it seems hard to imagine low GI rum balls), this doesn't matter. The only important thing is whether the texture of the Scotch oats be suitable. My sense is that they will be too firm to chew without cooking. Some rum ball recipes call for brief cooking, which may be enough to soften the Scotch oats. But if yours is a recipe that involves no cooking, and if you have the means, you may want to grind those oats more finely.

The main reasons not to store food in cast iron are:


* Foods, especially acidic foods, may continue to react with the iron, developing off flavors
* Moisture encourages cast iron to rust
* It is not good for maintenance of your pans seasoning, which is part of what makes cast iron pans so desirable for cooking
* Many cast iron skillets don't have a lid, which may be desirable to protect the food from drying out, getting odors and off flavors from other items in the refrigerator, or contributing odors *to* the other items in the refrigerator. This one, of course, applies to any pan.

4,How can I avoid cakes to turn into jelly?,"I am making cakes, and mostly chocolate cakes. But under certain conditions, instead of taking a nice bread texture (soft and with air bubbles), it turns into a kind of jelly (compact, a little bit translucent and without air bubbles). Needless to say, I dont want my cakes to turn into jelly because it is not good at all.


So I am interested to know under what circumstances the cakes turns into jelly.


*Quick information about how I proceed : (I don't think this has a big impact, tough I am not sure)*


*The basic ingredients I use are:*


* *Eggs*
* *Butter*
* *Wheat*
* *Sugar*


*Sometimes, I replace wheat with olive oil and I may add hazel powder, almond powder, vanilla sugar and/or chocolate, etc...
Most of the time, I start by fixing the eggs, uping egg whites and mixing the yellows and sugar.*


The majority of the time, my cakes are fine. There have been two cases where I had ""jelly problems"": 


* The first was where I tried to make a cake in a glass dish, into an oven with both pulsed heat and microwaves. No baking paper. This one was 100% jelly and non-eatable.
* The second was into a normal oven, with a dish with a somewhat plastic bottom and baking paper. This one had about 20% of the bottom turned into jelly and its eatable but not very good.


So my theory is that the cakes turns into jelly if:


* Air cannot flow into the cake, from the bottom, while baking. (The texture of the bottom of the dish matters)
* You use a non-thermal oven


Do you have the same issue ? Am I correct and how do you fix the problem ?


",<baking><cake><microwave>,2012-09-08 17:38:58.690,26068,5,"It could either be a problem of heat transfer or leavening.


**Heat Transfer**


Probably the bottom ""jelly"" potion of the cake is not getting enough heat. I can imagine some possibile causes. 


* Ovens that are not fan assisted are generally warmer at the top than at the bottom. Generally you should have the cake in the middle of the oven, but for some ovens you may need to move the cake higher.
* Plastic bakeware (or silicone if that's what you have) typically conducts heat less efficiently than glass. And glass has poorer heat transfer than metal, so try using a metal cake form.
* The oven temperature might be wrong; oven dials are often wrong by a few degrees (I once had an oven that was out by ten degrees C). Get an oven thermometer and put it on the same shelf as the cake.


Another possibility is that you just need to leave the cake in longer, but from what you say it sounds like the upper portion of the cake would then be overcooked and dry.


**Leavening**


In your ingredient list you didn't mention a leavening agent. That could be a problem in itself if you are expecting air bubbles. Typically you would use baking soda or baking powder, or a combination of those two (depending on the acidity of the batter) to introduce air.


It is possible to introduce air without a chemical leavening agent by, for example, folding whipped egg whites carefully into the batter.


In either case, air does not ""flow into the cake"". It needs to be introduced either before baking or by a leavening agent during baking.

3,How can I remove sticky residue from a pot I boiled salsify in?,"Yesterday I made black salsify. I got the salsify fresh and peeled it myself. Knowing what a hassle that is, I rinced and scrubbed it, put on disposable gloves and peeled in my sink, which afterwards I scrubbed down with a cleaning agent. I put the salsify in water with vinegar to avoid discoloration.


I peeled the salsify very thin, however. There were a few small spots of black peel left here and there, but since I was cooking for myself I didn't mind if it looked less than perfect. However, this might have left a bit of the sap on there and after cooking them, it has settled in my stainless steel pot on the sides, at where the water level was. The residue is sticky and extremely resilient.


I've tried scrubbing with a brush and detergent to no avail. After that I put in a mixture of water and vinegar hoping that would soak it loose, but without much success. Just now I took a scrubbing sponge to it with some kitchen cleaner, but no dice. I guess with continued use it might eventually start disappearing, but it's unsightly and probably not too hygienic. Any advice on what could successfully remove this rubbery substance?

6,How should I adapt a recipe if using very new dried yeast versus slightly older dried yeast?,"I make bread and pizza bases using ""fast action"" dried yeast (like this: <http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/groceries/index.jsp?bmUID=1287396076254> ).

I notice that when I have just purchased a packet that still has a few months to go on its ""best before"" date, I get really lovely fluffy bread and pizza. As the yeast approaches its ""best before"" date, it gets less and less effective, but simply adding more of it doesn't give the same results - should I change the recipe in some other way? For example, add more sugar, or less salt?

-use as toppings (pizza, burgers)

4,Ambiguities in Gravlax recipe,"I am going to make [Gravlax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravlax) and found the following recipe:  

<http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2011/11/30/chef-hamid-salmon-gravlax/>


Ingredient list:


* ***2 or 3 salmon fillets***, deboned with skin on
* 2 lemon, peel rasped/finely grated
* 1 orange, peel rasped/finely grated
* 300 ***mills*** sugar (by volume)
* 150 ***mills*** kosher salt (by volume)
* 50 grams dill, finely chopped
* 1 tbsp fennel seed, toasted ground


Question 1: I am assuming that by ""mills"" he means milliliters. It seems highly unlikely that it could mean anything else, but I hate guessing. Does anybody know for sure? 


Question 2: By ""2 or 3 salmon fillets"", does he mean 2-3 whole sides of salmon, or 2-3 portion-sized pieces of salmon fillet? Judging by the amount of salt and sugar (assuming of course that I am right in thinking that ""mills"" == milliliters) I think it should be the former. 


",<measurements><salmon>,2012-12-20 16:11:18.540,29344,4,"1 I would say with almost 100% certainty he's referring to Millilitres by volume. 300ml is just over 10 fluid ounces and 150ml just over 5, which sounds about right for the quantity you're marinating.


2 By 2 or 3 Salmon fillets, I would think he's referring to 2 or 3 portions of Salmon fillet. 2 or 3 sides would be far too much for the marination quantities he's specifying.


50g of dill and 1 tablespoon of fennel look right too, although I'd say that was a lot of fennel. 


Here's another one for it -


800g of salmon fillet, skin on, 3 tablespoons (45 ml) white sugar, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) Sea salt, 1 oz. (28 grams) fresh dill.

4,Where should I store my cakes?,"Where is the best place to store cakes?


I usually store them in a normal, plastic box but I had an idea to store them in a freezer. Would that be okay to store cakes there? Could it degrade the flavour and the taste? 


I'm asking because I don't want to throw away cakes which are both chocolate and ribbon, if that matters. 


",<storage-method><cake><freezing>,2013-01-01 15:46:47.247,29638,5,"Most cakes freeze extremely well--especially cakes that are not iced, such as bundt cakes.


Wrap the cake in plastic wrap, then aluminum foil, and freeze. For cupcakes or slices, you can put them in a freezer bag.


If you are going to freeze a whole cake, it is better to frost it after thawing, as the icing can be tricky. 


If you have icing, you can put the cake in the freezer long enough for the icing to br firm, and then wrap and freeze--however, thawing can be tricky as you might get a bit of condensation, which can affect the texture of the frosting.


EDIT in response to question about a plastic box, and why the double layering:


1. Boxes consume space extra space, often at a premium in a freezer, and offer air gaps in which freezer burn is more likely.
2. Not all plastic is food-safe.
3. The food-safe plastic wrap is for direct contact with the cake but is gas permeable. I suppose you could just go directly to foil, but things are more likely to stick to it.
4. The foil provides a gas and moisture barrier (and light, but that is less of a problem in the freezer).
5. The direct contact with the with the cake eliminates the air gaps, making freezer burn much less likely.

",<pizza><microwave>,2013-09-08 02:30:22.203,36603,6,"The only possible reason it could work is by increasing humidity in the oven cavity, and to do so in any significant amount, the water would have to be brought to a boil. Even so, there is no reason to believe that increased humidity would have any effect on the crust.


Otherwise, the only affect of the water is to provide an additional mass in the oven that will absorb the microwaves in competition with the pizza, essentially slowing down the heating process. It is conceivable that this might make it easier not to heat the pizza to the ""rubbery crust"" phase, but then the same effect could be achieved simply by lowering the power setting.


So no, there is no scientific basis for this belief other than the placebo affect.


Reheating pizza is one of the most challenging tasks, and there are many methods, none ideal.

13,How do the nutritional values of bananas change as they ripen?,"Unripe bananas are hard with thick skins and an unmistakeable raw flavour. As they ripen they shrink slightly, the skins become thinner, and the fruit becomes softer and sweeter; the raw flavour goes away. 


How does the nutritional composition of the fruit change during the transformation?


",<fruit><nutrient-composition><bananas><ripe>,2017-06-16 20:52:22.127,82580,7,"**Starch content and sweetness:**
Bananas become sweeter as they ripen because the starch is broken down. An unripe banana is full of complex carbohydrates, but as it ripens, these are broken down into simple sugars which is why riper bananas are sweeter. The lower starch content and higher sugar content also means that the banana is digested more quickly, so it becomes a slightly higher GI food as it ripens.


**Antioxidant levels:** Riper bananas also have higher levels of antioxidants. The brown spots on the skin are formed when the chlorophyll breaks down into antioxidants. These are very good for your body as they help prevent cell damage.


**Calorie count:** As the banana ripens, the calorie count stays the same. Even though the nutrients change, all carbohydrates contain 4 calories per gram so the total remains the same


**Vitamins and minerals:** As the fruit ripens, the micronutrients tend to decrease. Water soluble vitamins like vitamin C, folic acid and thiamin decrease. But the banana will still have a lot of potassium. You can store a ripe banana in the fridge to prevent some of these nutrients from being lost.

4,Cheesemaking produces strange bicolored whey,"I made some farmer cheese (heat milk, add vinegar, strain curds). I didn't have a strainer big enough to handle the whole batch, so I used two smaller strainers. Weirdly, the two sub-batches produced very different-looking whey (see photo). Why would this happen, and are both batches of whey safe to consume?[![One batch of cheese, whey of two colors.](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ln8vh.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ln8vh.jpg)


",<cheese-making>,2016-12-24 19:59:54.440,76822,2,"Neither batch looks like the color would, in and of itself, look worrisome for the whey pressed from farmer cheese. If there are no other worrisome factors (like an off smell, or unsafe handling), then I would probably assume that the whey, and the cheese, is safe to eat - though your risk tolerance may vary.


As for why the batches look different - it looks like one batch still contains some milk proteins emulsified in it. I've seen very milky looking whey (it happens when the curd didn't set cleanly), so again, by itself it wouldn't make me hesitate. I notice that that batch also looks bigger - which might just mean your batches were unevenly split, but could also indicate you got a little less of the milk proteins out of that batch, more remained to color the whey, and you perhaps got less curd out of that batch.


As for why the batches came out differently, I can only speculate. It could be one batch had a bit longer to cure than the other (while you were processing the other batch, perhaps), so the curds with a bit more time separated from the whey a bit more cleanly. It could be that the milky proteins were kind of hovering more at the top, or else settling down at the bottom of the curds-and-whey mixture, and so when you were pouring it into the two strainers, one poured clearer and one got all the extra milky coloration. It could be that one strainer had a better filter to catch the milky proteins, or one strainer pressed harder and wrung out more of the whey - including those extra proteins.


If I'm right, then the whey on the right (whiter and more volume) should be able to be curdled again into some kind of whey cheese, to get the rest of the milky proteins out of it, while the one on the left would produce much less (if any) if re-curdled.


Again, you should be wary, and discard if there's off smells, tastes or textures, or if you have reason to believe the milk, cheese, or whey was unsafely handled. But if the only difference is the color and proportion of leftover milk proteins, then both batches should be safe to use.

3,"When baking quick breads and cakes, can I premix wet ingredients the night before?","When baking quick breads and cakes, I've premixed dry ingredients the night before to save time. Can I premix wet ingredients as well?


I understand that I can't premix the full batter when using leavening agents -- I am curious if I can save some time the day of while preparing the batter by premixing both the wet and dry ingredients separately beforehand.


The following is an example of a recipe for which I was thinking of doing this (wet ingredients would be the egg and buttermilk mixture):



>

> 
> 
> 1 1/4 cups buttermilk, milk, or yogurt (or 1 1/4 cups milk plus 1 tablespoon white vinegar; see Step 2), plus more as needed
> 
> 
> 2 tablespoons butter or extra virgin olive oil
> 
> 
> 1 1/2 cups medium-grind cornmeal

> 
> 1/2 cup all-purpose flour

> 
> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder

> 
> 1. Preheat the oven to 375°F.
> 2. If you’re using buttermilk, milk, or yogurt, ignore this step. If not, make the soured milk: Warm the milk gently—1 minute in the microwave is sufficient, just enough to take the chill off—and add the vinegar. Let it rest while you prepare the other ingredients.
> 3. Put the butter in a medium ovenproof skillet or an 8-inch square baking pan over medium heat; heat until good and hot, about 2 minutes, then turn off the heat. Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl. Mix the egg into the buttermilk. Stir the liquid into the dry ingredients (just enough to combine); if it seems too dry, add another tablespoon or two of buttermilk. Pour the batter into the prepared skillet or pan, smooth out the top if necessary, and put in the oven.
> 4. Bake about 30 minutes, until the top is lightly browned and the sides have pulled away from the pan; a toothpick inserted into the center will come out clean. Serve hot or warm.

With quick breads you just don't want to activate your leavened prematurely. That happens when the wet and dry mix so you're fine.


Two things to watch out for:


The eggs and buttermilk are going to be more prone to spoiling after they are removed from their containers. Additionally, the batter could pick up funny flavors from the fridge. Storing in an appropriate container in the fridge and using it the next day would avoid any issues.


The wet ingredients, including the eggs, are emulsified when they are mixed. The oil dissolves into the buttermilk with the help of the egg yolks. This emulsification is important for the texture of quick breads. The emulsion is not indestructible. If you find your oil has separated in the morning you may need to beat it again to reemulsify before combining with the dry.


Note: your title says ""and cakes"". Cakes are assembled with different methods such as creaming or beating egg whites. These could not be done in advance without destroying the texture of the cake.

3,Salt stick dough and shaping,"Having been given a copy of ""Inside the Jewish Bakery"", by Ginsberg and Berg, I set out to reproduce a treat of my childhood: salt sticks.


Basic outline: make a slightly enriched dough ('medium vienna + one egg'). Ferment, make logs, cut triangles, rest.


Now comes the fun part: the dough is fairly soft and sticky. Instructions are: stretch out triangles to six inches wide, then roll down with heel of one hand while stretching out tip of triangle with the other. If this seems a bit less that perfectly clear, well, that's part of my problem.


I find that the dough is far too sticky to cooperate with being rolled up with the heel of my hand on a 'lightly floured board'.


Any ideas? I am carefully weighing the ingredients, so I don't think it's a measuring problem.


",<baking><bread>,2013-07-09 22:17:04.457,35221,3,"Water absorption by flour varies by variety, brand, and even batch within brand. For example, I have an American bread book where I quite often have to use far more water than the recipe suggests to achieve the consistency stated. This is down to my British flour apparently absorbing more water.


Therefore, it's a good idea to simply use enough flour to get the desired consistency rather than worry too much about being precise. Having said that, when it comes to bread, wetter is better, so only add enough so that you can *just* work it comfortably.

12,Why did my chicken soup go cloudy?,"I made chicken soup tonight in my usual way - recipe is chicken flash fried, then onion, ginger, garlic added, then stock or water, then lid on and cook. Coriander added later. 


Usually, I end up with a mostly clear soup, lots of floating bits of herbs, spices, meat etc, which are fine. 


Tonight, the soup was completely cloudy. A dense yellow colour, which didn't settle after leaving it to cool for 40mins and then reheating it (which I thought may help it 'settle'). 


Why would this happen? It didn't seem to affect the flavour too much, although I noticed that it was a heavier soup than normal. Are there any immediate health or safety concerns associated with a cloudy soup?


",<chicken><soup>,2010-12-07 00:16:09.827,9845,14,"My guess would be that you boiled the soup at some point, possibly for an extended period of time.


If you bring it to a full boil the fat from the meat will emulsify and distribute itself through the liquid. This is the same stuff that foams to the top, the ""scum"" that a lot of recipes (usually ones that say bring to a boil, then simmer) tell you to skim off. I would venture to say that this distribution of the fat into the liquid is also why it tasted heavier.


When making stock or soups, the most I'll heat them is to just *below* boiling and keep them at that simmer for a little longer to make up for not bringing it to a boil. When making stock, I strain once through a chinois and again through a piece of cheesecloth in a chinois to help reduce the floating particulates, but this won't really solve the cloudiness problem (though it will help some).


You can also try putting it into the fridge overnight so that the fat comes to the top and solidifies, but I don't think this will solve the problem, only help reduce it.


If it's just the stock that's gone cloudy, [this page](http://www.ehow.com/how_4933041_clarify-cloudy-chicken-stock.html) has some suggestions on how to clarify it, but honestly unless you're presenting it to guests, I see no reason to even bother. I've made cloudy stock and clear stock before and except for a slight ""heaviness"" difference, the taste is generally about the same. The cloudy stock sometimes has a more oily mouth feel, but it's not a major difference - and I've found some people seem to prefer the soups or rices I make with a cloudy stock. 


If you have a hard time controlling the temperature on your range-top, you can use an oven-safe stock pot and cook it in the oven at 180°F to keep it just below a boil.


One other trick, depending on what kind of soup you were making - if you were making (for example) chicken soup, consider trying to turn it into a cream of chicken soup to hide the cloudy broth :)

",<soup><brining>,2012-05-19 15:27:57.690,23842,6,"Salt dissolves in water. Brining is simply the process of soaking something in a saline solution so that either it absorbs saltwater, or the salinity of the pre-existing water approaches equilibrium with that of the brine. The end state is just a lot of water, some on/inside the meat and some outside, all with approximately the same salinity.


If you roast the result, you're evaporating most of the water but keeping the salt. If you boil it, then you're just reversing the brining process you followed in the first place, by diluting whatever salt (not to mention any other minerals/flavour) it has.


The salt in a brined chicken is not reacting with the meat, it's just dissolved in the water (which is in/on the meat). Give it a good enough ""rinse"" and the salt water will be gone.

11,Cooking Buffet-style Bacon,"When I was a kid, every month we would go out to a high-end restaurant or country club buffet for Sunday brunch. At these buffets, I would be confronted with hotel pans with fancy chrome lids resting in their stands above Sterno stoves. In one of these pans would be one of my favorite things: bacon. Thin, very evenly browned in a deep red color, lacking any char marks, and also with none of the broad strips of chewy fat I was used to, these paranormally crispy, light productions were somehow piled high in ten pound portions in a pan, free for the taking.


Now, my parent's and my own history of pan-cooking bacon produced none of these qualities. Differential rates of shrinking end up with bacon that never cooks evenly and turns wrinkly (whereas many strips of 'Buffet Bacon' end up flat as a board), and always with significant texture differences between fat and lean streaks, something that was difficult to discern in this dish. I've finally managed to create a bacon product I enjoy more than my parent's iteration, with thick center-cut bacon cooked on low heat for half an hour, only half a dozen strips at a time... but I still wonder at the crispy deliciousness I enjoyed as a kid, produced in such quantities as I can barely imagine. The few attempts I've made at oven-cooking bacon either resulted in the strips sticking together or a series of small greasefires.


How would I replicate 'buffet bacon'?


",<bacon>,2013-01-06 00:20:21.277,29778,12,"Restaurants--especially large scale catering and buffets--almost always bake bacon.


It is extremely effective, and very easy.


Lay the bacon out on rimmed sheet pans, in a single layer. For extra crispiness, use a rack, but cleaning the racks is not fun. 


Bake at 350-400 F (I give a temperature range since you may be using the oven for other items) for approximately 20-30 minutes (depending on temperature, thickness of bacon, and desired level of crispiness).


If you didn't use a rack, remove the bacon to paper towels to soak up the excess grease.


The bacon will be very flat and very uniform, and can get very crispy.

10,Why is my green tea brown?,"As Crystal Gale once wrote, ""[You're gonna make my green tea, brown.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0aT0GXW8jw)"" Or something like that.


When I typically order (the free or close-to-free) green tea at Japanese restaurants, it's usually noticeably green. At home, regardless of brand and time on the shelf, it's typically brownish. I follow good guidelines for making green tea: 170 degrees for about 90 seconds.


Am I buying the wrong kind of tea; or are restaurants using food coloring?


UPDATE: I'm pretty sure the Japanese or sushi restaurant green tea I'm used to is either partially or fully matcha, giving it the distinctive green color. After trying out many different green teas, some Japanese, some not, it seems that Japanese green teas are generally greener in color than non-japanese, and the matcha powder provides the greenest color by far. Some green tea bags come with matcha powder mixed into the tea bags, including Costco's green tea. I found it to be better than any of the many bagged green teas I bought at the asian grocer.


",<tea><color><coloring>,2012-09-19 21:28:02.047,27289,16,"Hojicha is a green tea which is made from bancha, a low grade green tea, and cooked slightly; this very inexpensive green tea often comes out brown because it is discolored by oxidation. Other than this variety, and some very stale bancha, I can't think of a Japanese green tea that comes out brown. Some stale kukicha might come out brown, and low quality genmaicha made with poor quality kukicha could be brownish from the combination of excess oxidation and the toasted rice.


Most of the non-Japanese green teas I've seen sold as ""green tea"" and some lower quality teabags marked as ""sencha"" are broken down tea leaves that can easily oxidize in the packaging to the point where they are, at best, yellowish.


However, if you use even a moderate quality sencha, and it isn't stale, it should come out green. Most good quality kukicha and genmaicha will at least come out greenish-yellow. Since most Japanese restaurants use a fairly inexpensive second-harvest sencha, I imagine you're either buying hojicha or simply using a very stale, low-quality sencha.


Chinese green teas are sometimes slightly yellow, but if they're actually yielding a brown brew, they, too are either stale or are simply mislabeled oolong.


I used to sell a fair amount of green tea when I ran a small scale import business. I do recall even matcha products turning brown after being exposed to excessive sunlight; one of the bakeries I know was constantly running into issues with their matcha pound cake slices on sunny days, especially those pieces in the front of their pastry case. So it's reasonably possible you simply have tea which has been stored improperly; you're best off with a nitrogen flushed tea and it should be used within about 6 months of opening the sealed package. If your tea comes unsealed, it probably isn't in very good shape to begin with.


In any event, my recommendation is to try a first-harvest high-mountain grown sencha that is sold in nitrogen-flushed aluminum packages. Depending on the style, the brewed color will be either very green or slightly yellowish if brewed in the typical way. You can either do a very brief, several second infusion at near-boiling, or a longer infusion at around 80 celsius. I like it both ways.


Gyokuro, if you can afford it, is extraordinarily green, but is unlikely to be served at a restaurant without an additional charge (it's essentially the same leaves used to make matcha, except rolled instead of being milled).

5,Is there any difference between a given cream and mix of different milks resulting in the same fat percentage?,"Is there any difference between a given cream and mix of different milks resulting in the same fat percentage?


For example, is there any difference in a half-and-half cream, say 16% of fat, and a 50% mix of skim milk and 33% fat heavy cream?


",<milk><cream><fats>,2012-12-29 13:51:39.453,29553,5,"What is the application?


For most uses, no, there would be little to no effective difference.


Dairy products are a mixture of water, sugars, minerals (which the dairy industry calls ash, because they are left as ash when burned in a calorimeter), proteins, and fat. 


If the product is not homogonized, the fat globules will eventually rise to the surface (where they can be skimmed as cream, giving rise to the term skim milk for when the cream has been removed). If the product is homogonized, the fat has been forced into much smaller globules which form a stable emulsion, and will not rise.


Whipping non-homogonized cream is much easier, but most of us (at least in the US) do not have easy access to such a product.


Additionally, most dairy products are pasteurized in one of the various methods, slow or fast, which can affect the flavor.


Other than these differences in flavor or whipability, you can mix them with little difference for most applications.


Note: to your specific question, your mixture of smim milk and cream may actually be richer than commercial half and half, which is often about 12% milkfat, but it would function very similarly.


Of course, all the above only applies to fresh products--basic milk or cream of various fat percentages. Fermented products like yogurt, creme fraiche, cottage cheese, buttermilk, and so forth have entirely different charactaristics.

40,"What's the difference between latte, mocha, and all the other drinks on a coffee-house menu?","There are many different coffee-based drinks on an average coffee-house menu. But what makes them different from each other? What are the differences / distinguishing characteristics between: latte, caffe misto, cappuccino, mocha, macchiato, Americano, and Cafe Au Lait?


",<coffee>,2012-04-25 19:06:05.817,23341,56,"1. Espresso: This is a finely ground very dark roast coffee, packed somewhat tightly in a special metal filter, with water ""expressed"" through it under pressure. A very strong dark coffee, typically served in 1-2 ounce portions. Very commonly incorrectly called ""Expresso.""
2. Americano: Italians typically don't drink American Strength coffee. They drink espresso in tiny cups. Then the tourists came and wanted a mug of coffee like they get at home. The Italian solution was to make an espresso and keep the water running through the grounds to weaken the coffee, and make the desired quantity. (edit: Some locations may simply add hot water to the espresso in the cup. This doesn't change the basic concept.) An Americano is simply an espresso that has been drawn out with extra water to an American strength beverage -- Not to be confused with the typical brewed coffee, which is usually filtered.
3. Caffe au Lait: This is strong filtered or brewed coffee (not espresso), with warmed milk. This is probably the easiest specialty coffee to make at home. Just scald some milk in a pot and pour it over strongly brewed coffee.
4. Cappuccino: A 1:1:1 ratio of espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam. Typically the milk is steamed through a special high pressure steam pipe on the espresso machine. This serves two functions. To warm up the milk and to create a stiff foam on the top. When pouring, the foam is held back with a spoon, and then scooped out on top. I'll arbitrarily define the cappuccino as the base beverage for all that follow.
5. Macchiato: Typically in North America, this is a cappuccino, but with the steamed milk component missing. That is, it is espresso and frothed milk foam only. Also called a ""Dry"" Cappuccino. Macchiato has different meanings elsewhere.
6. Latte: A ""wet"" cappuccino. Hold back the foam with a spoon, and pour the warm milk over the espresso. Put a little bit of foam on top for decoration only.
7. Mocha: Any one of the above espresso + milk drinks with chocolate added. Some places will add hot chocolate to the drink, others will add a chocolate syrup. A mocha latte is the common preparation. Not to be confused with Mocha beans, which are an Ethiopian coffee bean which has a little bit of a naturally occurring chocolate flavour.
8. Misto: A Starbucks synonym for a Cafe au Lait.

8,Bean selection for a chili recipe,"*I am planning on making a new chili using grilled venison, Great Lakes Black Out Stout, and roasted corn* (I'm in Ohio and sweet corn is getting good right now).

5,Dipping sauce for shabu-shabu,"I am at the Hilton in Narita, and I've just come back from a wonderful meal of [Shabu-shabu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabu-shabu). One of the dipping sauces was stated to be soy sauce, but it had a lovely sweet sort of flavor to it, so it clearly was more than just plain shoyu. It came with green onions and something pink that was stated to be spicy to mix into it. What was likely to have been in it? Is this something I can recreate at home?


",<sauce><restaurant-mimicry><japanese-cuisine>,2014-03-29 12:46:58.853,43154,5,"There are a number or styles of soy sauces used in Japanese cuisine. Saishikomi shoyu is sometimes described as sweet compared to regular Koikuchi shoyu.

Kikkoman makes an ""enhanced"" soy sauce that they call Amakuchi shoyu that is sweetened with corn syrup, as well as another call Umukuchi shoyu that has added MSG for savoriness. Teriyaki sauces, especially those made for use as a marinade, can be as liquid as standard soy sauce and are sweetened with sugar or corn syrup.


A traditional dipping sauce for shabu shabu is a 1:1:1 mixture of shoyu, dashi, and mirin reduced by 1/3 with rice vinegar added to taste. If you wanted it even sweeter, you could just add sugar to taste once it has reduced.

The longer recommendations attribute the jarred anchovies lasting longer because of the oil (""as long as they're completely covered"") and the paste being safe because of the salt, along with metal tubing not allowing air to ruin it.

1,Sauce made from butter and cream flakes/curdles,"My sauce recipe (Laurent Tourondel, BLT p 140) called for heavy cream and butter to be set on high heat:

1. Would this potentially make my waffles fluffier (due to increased CO2 producing reactions or otherwise)?
2. Would it impact the flavor of the waffles?
3. Is it safe to ingest waffles that have had a lye water reaction occur in them? (Obviously I should let the lye reaction complete before ingesting).
	1. How long should I let a lye reaction occur before cooking?


Notably, I often use sourdough starter in my waffles, which has an acid component - I've noticed that I get a strong reaction from the baking soda as a result, and it got me thinking that I would get an even stronger result from lye, but I'm worried about taste and ingestion safety.

In short, lye, while caustic, will not create a chemical reaction producing CO2, which is what baking soda does during leavening. So lye is at-best an inferior leavening approach, and in most cases, won't work as a leavening ingredient at all.

1. Does the paddle scrape the bottom? If so, raise it up until it doesn't (paddle height is adjustable.)
2. Does the paddle hit the sides as it rotates? If so, your bowl is not wide enough. Get a wider bowl.


If you were mixing a very small amount, you might find that, due to the angle of the curve of the bowl, it is not optimum in getting everything amalgamated, but for the most part, a bowl is a bowl. Just like with the supplied bowl, you probably have to scrape sides every now and again to make sure everything's mixing together anyway.

When cutting it, the layers fell apart and the taste was almost sweet, without any aggressive onion taste. If I did not look closely at what I was eating I could miss the fact that it was an onion.


What would be the right approach to cook an onion like this? Boil it and then sauté? Cook it in butter for a long time at a low temperature?


",<onions>,2017-06-26 20:21:27.970,82662,3,"I usually steam them until they are soft in bulk and then store them in fridge. When I need to use them I just throw on butter. 
I don't use much salt when steaming but I always taste the green part. If it have this spicy (but not oniony) taste I brisk the heads in cold water for a second and then put them on steam (I don't keep them in the steamer from the beginning).


Usually keeping vegetables cold or even freeze them for a short while will bring the sweet taste.

2,Making patties from half-cooked ground beef,"My roommate decided to store a sizable purchase of ground beef in the freezer. For reasons I don't entirely understand, he would thaw it as needed at cook temperature in the microwave, then refreeze.


Quite a bit of this beef remains, and it's been in the refrigerator since I discovered his shenanigans, but unfortunately it's difficult to make patties out of the meat because it's partially cooked. I don't want it to go to waste, so what might I use to hold it together while making burgers that still taste like burgers?

You can try adding binders like egg and/or peanut butter (or bananas if you're vegan, har har) in order to firm up your beef for pan frying (forget the grill, it ain't happenin), but, while that will help, it'll definitely change the flavor...possibly for the better. I've been known to add those things to regular ground beef (Also, applesauce, which will not help your problem here, but is quite tasty).

2,How do I keep boiled pasta from getting sticky overnight?,"When I boil pasta and store it overnight in the refrigerator, it sticks to itself. Is there a way I can avoid this stickiness?


",<pasta>,2018-11-04 15:13:14.150,93585,0,"As soon as it's cooked, rinse it with plenty of cold water, tossing it around so it's not stuck together. Then shake off as much water as you can and put it in a closed container in the fridge.


Some people like to put a little oil in their pasta-cooking water, claiming it makes the pasta stick together less. That's worth a try as well.

2,How to bake frozen chicken without setting off fire alarms?,"I was able to bake frozen chicken for the longest time in my oven (~6 months). However, recently the fire alarms in my apartment started going off. So I noticed it was a little dirty and cleaned it out with Easy Off, and cooked non-frozen chicken and all seemed to work out fine. Tonight however I tried to cook 4 frozen chicken thighs (1.75lbs) in a glassware container by themselves and put very little PAM spray in the bottom of it and placed a cookie sheet on top... the alarms went off again. What am I doing wrong? On the package for the chicken it says to bake at 350F and I've tacked on 50% of the cooking time since it's frozen. But the alarms went off after only ~30mins. If anyone could point me in the right direction I'd appreciate it! Thanks!


",<chicken><frozen>,2014-11-03 00:43:39.947,49483,3,"If I understand you correctly, you're putting frozen chicken thighs in a glassware dish that's been sprayed with Pam and then putting that into a 350F oven. 


Since the chicken will take quite a while to thaw and begin emitting juices that will cool the dish, that dish is going to rise to 350F fairly quickly. 350F is hot enough to begin smoking with many oils. Not sure about Pam's smoke point, but I would bet that if you looked in the oven when the smoke alarm is going off, you'll see smoke rising from the pan itself, not the chicken or the oven. 


Solution: Thaw the chicken before cooking or apply oil to the chicken but not the pan.

3,Non-Quick Cooking Couscous - Is that a real thing anywhere?,"To me a big part of the fun of cooking meals traditional elsewhere is to do it ""right"". So I'd like to try to approximate using a [couscousier](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B003L8A0L2) as I play with my new North African ingredients. Almost all of the couscous I've been able to find (even on Amazon) is either labeled ""quick cooking"", or there are instructions on the box that say basically to add water, bring it to a boil, cover and let it sit for five minutes. I've found some couscous that doesn't offer any instructions, leaving it a mystery, but nothing that clearly says, ""This is the real stuff, it takes time to cook."" There is even couscous in the bulk aisle of my local grocery that has no instructions. I thought, ""AHA! This *must* be the stuff"". I called the company to be sure, but alas, same quick-cooking stuff.


I look at this recipe though [Traditional North African Couscous](http://www.food.com/recipe/traditional-north-african-couscous-the-real-way-232404) and it seems pretty clear that this recipe does not refer to a product that can be made *adequate* by treating it like Stove-Top Stuffing. What gives? Is there such a thing as non-quick cooking couscous? If so, can you tell me how to get a hold of some?


",<pasta><shopping><middle-eastern-cuisine>,2013-12-07 22:53:50.573,40058,3,"[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couscous#Preparation) implies that there is a difference between fast cooking cous-cous sold in western markets and the traditional product:



> 
> The couscous that is sold in most Western supermarkets has been
>  pre-steamed and dried, the package directions usually instruct to add
>  1.5 measures of boiling water or stock and butter to each measure of couscous and to cover tightly for 5 minutes. The couscous swells and
>  within a few minutes it is ready to fluff with a fork and serve.
>  Pre-steamed couscous takes less time to prepare than regular couscous,
>  most dried pasta, or dried grains (such as rice).
> 
> 
> 


According to [Fine Cooking](http://www.finecooking.com/articles/making-moroccan-couscous.aspx?pg=2), you can get moister and more fluffy result with the traditional steaming method, even with quick cooking cous cous.


If you want the traditional product, you could go back to basics and make your own, as described by this [NY Times article and video](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/28/dining/crafting-couscous-no-grain-no-gain.html?_r=0).

8,"When creating a recipe, what determines whether 2 ingredients will go well together?","Over the weekends when I have more time to play in the kitchen, I often experiment by putting things together just to see how they taste/interact with each other. I've been doing this pretty randomly and have had a variety of results. Here are some ""recipes"" that I have tried recently:


* marshmallow chicken (surprisingly good, like peanut chicken)
* coffee and sour cream (ok I didn't *want* to do this, but I was out of half & half, awful)
* chocolate chip stuffing (excellent, just make sure to spread out the chocolate pieces)
* peanut butter salami sandwich (highly recommended)
* jalapeño ice cream (do not try this at home)


These are just a small selection of my samplings, but are there any guidelines on how to pair ingredients when cooking, or is it like the Large Hadron Collider and just hope they hit the right way to find something that tastes good?


",<food-science>,2010-12-03 18:09:44.183,9761,5,"When it comes to pairing specific ingredients, the general thinking seems to be that ingredients that share ""flavour notes"" in significant quantity will go well together.


In practice it goes much deeper than that, because in addition to taste, foods have very specific and recognizable *aromas* which affect the perception of flavour; wine is mostly sweet and sour, but you wouldn't substitute ordinary grape juice for it; the aroma of the alcohol is unmistakable, and even between different wines you will have varying levels of ""fruitiness"" or ""woodiness"".


But let's start with tastes:


* Chocolate and coffee go well together because they share characteristic bitter notes. The roasting of the beans also makes a difference; the pairing works best when the roasting is enough to thermally degrade the bitterness without losing too much sweetness due to caramelization. This emphasizes the sweetness and de-emphasizes the bitterness and acidity of the coffee, making it closer to the flavour profile of chocolate.
* A traditional stock combines a mirepoix (onions, carrots, celery) with meat (well, bones), both very high in umami. The end product may have varying notes of bitterness or saltiness from the vegetables but is basically one huge kick of umami. A lot of people also enjoy peanut butter and bacon together, which combines the significant umami *and* saltiness in both foods.
* Beets and sour cream are a traditional (or so I'm told) Polish dish, both obviously sharing strong sour notes. Often chives are added, which are mildly *pungent* in nature and pungency tends to go with sour or bitter (since it is created by sulfur which is perceived as sour, bitter, and also ""metallic"").


This tends to work reasonably well for basic pairings, but another very strong element of this is *balancing* all of the different flavours in a dish.


* Peanut butter and jam don't seem to have much in common, flavour-wise. But when you combine them together in a sandwich you have the high umami and saltiness of the peanut butter, the sweet and slightly sour notes of the jam, and the hints of bitterness and/or sourness in the bread. Together you have strong notes of all five tastes and the result is appealing to most people.
* Five Spice is usually a mixture of cinnamon (sweet), star anise (mildly sweet and bitter), fennel (mildly sweet and fairly savoury), ground cloves (pungent and somewhat bitter), and Szechuan peppercorns (salty and pungent with a sour aftertaste). The quantities are generally adjusted to balance out the tastes; for example, fennel is the only really savoury ingredient so Five Spice tends to have more of that than other ingredients. Anyway, this is used all over Chinese cuisine as a sort of ""wonder spice"".
* A really good roast chicken starts off high in umami and is then brined (salty), buttered (sweet), and roasted which involves the Maillard reaction (bitter). This is missing sour, which is why a lot of cooks will throw a few lemon slices in there.


But truthfully, even though this all sounds plausible, it's really *so* much more complicated than that. Even though there's *some* science at work here, the five tastes are a little like the four elements or humours; it's an almost archaic way of thinking about food chemistry, because our mouths and noses can detect so much more than that.


If you want to see just how *little* we actually really know about flavour today, check out [They Go Really Well Together](http://blog.khymos.org/tgrwt/) on Khymos, linked to from one of the related questions. There you'll see totally nonsensical combinations like chocolate and garlic or mint and mustard that actually - with the right preparation of course - produce pretty pleasant flavours/aromas.


The truth is people are still gathering data on this and we don't really *know*, exactly, what makes some flavours work together. At least we're *starting* to approach this scientifically and actually experiment and document this stuff, but there's not enough data to form a coherent theory yet. Check the answers to my [question about flavour pairings](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/8316/41) and the other question on [pairing resources](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/2770/41) if you want detailed data on which flavour pairings can ""work"", although you might not get much of an explanation for *why*.

3,What is this dipped powder cookie called?,"After hunting around online for ""black and white cookies"" and ""powdered sugar and cocoa powder cookies"", I can't find what kind of cookie I am looking for.


Not the black and white glazed cookie:


![Black and White Cookie](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xf4snm.jpg)


I am thinking of a cookie I had as a kid that is made of a slightly sweet, heavy, and egg-sized lump of dough. The lump of dough is baked, and then one half is dipped in powdered sugar, and the other half is dipped in cocoa powder. Then you eat it.

I made the cookies a couple nights ago- they are a bit time-consuming to bake and dip, but I ended up with the cookies that I remembered- light and covered half with cocoa powder and half with confectioners' sugar. I used little bowls of powder to dip the cookies in. Here is a picture that I took of the finished cookie:

In terms of eating them, I recommend eating the entire cookie in one bite. If you decide to have a little nibble, you won't really enjoy the whole mixture of the flavors of the cocoa and the sugar at once :) Enjoy.

2,Why might I have trouble making butter from Crème Fraîche?,"I tried making cultured butter today from a supermarket variety crème fraîche. For some reason the butter hasn't split from the whey although I've ""churned"" it with the hand mixer for 20 minutes or more.


[This recipe for cultured butter](http://foodinjars.com/2011/04/transforming-homemade-creme-fraiche-into-cultured-butter) suggests that about 2 to 5 minutes is needed with a food processor, and my previous experience with the hand mixer is about 10 minutes for sweet butter.


I checked the ingredients list of the crème fraîche and I don't see anything unusual: cream\* and an unspecified culture. That's it. No artificial thickeners for example.


What could be the problem?


**Update:**


I'll just note one avenue I've already explored: temperature. I've tried varying the temperature during churning from just above freezing to around room temperature. 


\* The cream is ""högpastöriserad"" which is Swedish for a pasteurization process where the cream is held at 80°C for 5 seconds. I'm not sure this term translates directly to a common English term.


",<butter><dairy><creme-fraiche>,2014-05-22 17:23:36.043,44338,2,"If you were using supermarket cream, the reason would be very clear: it is not only pasteurized, but also homogenized. This means that it has been mechanically emulsified to prevent the butter from separating. 


I don't know if the cream for creme fraiche is homogenized too before creme fraiche is made, but with your result, I'd suspect homogenization too. It won't show up on the label as an ingredient, as it is done by forcing the cream through microfilters.

* the pan might warp (if it is thin)
* the food might scorch or burn (again, more likely if the pan is thin)
* the pan might stain (especially if there are areas of it that have only oil on them - for example if you're roasting a piece of meat)
* the food might stick to the pan and not come out well


If the pan is thick, and not a lot of it will be empty and exposed, then it should be fine. Another thing to consider is how you're going to get it out again after cooking. I don't see any handles.

5,Why are my apple fritters too doughy in the center?,"I'm making deep-fried apple fritters, and the recipe I am using has me drop them into oil as batter (a bit runny). Dropping them in as batter gives them the kind of crispy-bumpy outside I like.


My problem is that they always end up doughy in the center, because if they cook all the way to the center, the outside will be burnt. I have tried making them more doughy (less water) but that gets rid of the crispy-bumpy outside, and makes them quite dense.


Is there some way for me to make them thinner so that they are not doughy, or how else might I be able to get the center well done, and not lose the crispy-bumpyness?

2,White goo from chicken ruins the dish,"When I bake chicken breast, some unsavory white gunk comes out. It is a [perfectly edible protein](https://www.bestfoodfacts.org/white-goo-on-chicken/), but not pleasant to eat. And when I cook the chicken with vegetables in a pressure cooker, the gunk gets all over the vegetables. What is the best way prevent the gunk from coming out or keep it separate?


",<pressure-cooker><chicken-breast>,2020-04-02 13:07:21.893,107241,1,"When I bake chicken I usually use, depending on how and what for I cook it, a deep tray with grill/baking/cooling rack.

Or I use tray with a concave in the middle where all the juices (and proteins) gather. I've also seen ones that have a canal around the bottom to gather juices. 


When cooking there are two schools. One, practiced by my grandmothers is to cook chicken soup (or chicken in any liquid) on very low heat for a very long time. That' way the proteins don't get out (they call them noise).  

The other way is to have more liquid than it's needed, that way the foam will form on the surface while all the veggies and chicken will fall to the bottom. Then you just filter it with a slotted spoon. I learned that you can only do this once (and it's beest to do when foam is kinda grayish from protein. As otherwise you will break the proteins and they will mix with the liquid. Then you need to use colander with big holes to filter solids and then rinse them. And filter luqid through very small holes (cloth) to remove proteins.

This can usually be ensured by following a recipe that is known to be good, which should have factors like acidity and water activity accounted for.


As for kahm yeast, it seems that this occurs more frequently on cultured vegetables which would spend some of their time in a less acidic environment (while the culture develops and acidifies). I suppose you could culture it and test it, but when in doubt I'd just toss it.

28,What does al dente really mean?,"Initially I was told that al dente meant that the pasta was cooked but still firm, definitely not soggy or overcooked. Later, someone told me that it meant not quite cooked all the way through. Actually many people began telling me this. In addition, they would also tell me that it was silly to make such a request because no one in their right mind would eat pasta this way.


So what does al dente really mean? 


",<pasta><language><noodles>,2012-09-12 06:52:57.677,26124,23,"""Al dente"" is used to refer to food cooked so it is still ""firm to bite"" but not soft


This is very important to pasta which should be removed from the cooking liquid just before it has fully cooked through, as like most foods, it will continue to cook after being removed from the heat source


Always gently stir your pasta every minute or so while cooking to ensure it cooks evenly. Then near the end of the cooking time, bite into a piece of paste every 15 seconds or so to see if it has nearly cooked through. It should be firm to bite, and not soft all the way through. It should not resist biting though


With some pasta types like Penne etc. you can sometimes actually see the uncooked inner layer (a thin white line) if you carefully slice it in half which a knife, or just bite cleanly with your teeth


![section through al dente pasta](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Quh34.jpg)


If the pasta is going to be mixed into a hot liquid sauce before serving, take the pasta out of the cooking liquid at an even firmer point


The term ""al dente"" can be used for all cooked foods that should be cooked to just before soft, and then served (fresh greens, thin meat cuts etc.)


The reason for all of this is that there have been many flavour and nutrition benefits noted when cooking to this point. Also for pasta it tends to fall apart if cooked past ""al dente""

3,Why does pressure cooking of chicken eggs make eggs easier to peel?,"In an experiment, I cooked a 12 organic chicken eggs from the same batch:


A) 6 in boiling water and 


B) 6 in a pressure cooker: 


* 6 eggs in a basket which is on a tripod inside the cooker
* 5 minutes in hot steam at 117 °C
* waited 5 minutes to cool down until the pressure was at room level
* alternatively I cooled the cooker with cold water from outside until the pressure was gone.


In both experiments the eggs were put in the cold cooker **without a hole in the shell**. The eggs were put in a bowl with cold water in the end. 


I found that the shell and membrane of the pressure-cooked eggs were a lot easier to remove. (The eggs also seemed to taste fresher and more intense.) I could not find a reason or explanation. I have repeated this since 2016 once a week. 


The effect is remarkable, because organic eggs are often much more difficult to peel than factory farming eggs.


**Is there an explanation for the pressure-cooked eggs being easier to peel?**

7,What am I doing wrong with my pressure cooker?,"Every time I try to cook beef in my pressure cooker it gets dry and inedible.


Today I tried with 2 x 450 g (2 x 1 lb) beef, with .5 l (2 cups) water and 25 minutes.


The result was very dry and there were .7 l (3 cups) liquid.


What I was hoping for was the meat would be so tender that it would pretty much fall apart when trying to cut it.


I have seen charts like [this](http://www.fabulousfoods.com/articles/27943/how-to-cook-meat-in-a-pressure-cooker) one, but that would cover the meat in water. Can that be right?


I suppose that .5 l water is way too much, as I ended up with .7 l afterwards.


**Question**


Have anyone experience with beef in pressure cookers, and can guide me on what the problem could be?


Should I have fried the beef on a pan before putting it in the pressure cooker?


",<meat><pressure-cooker>,2012-02-20 00:49:22.583,21521,7,"I use a pressure cooker quite often and its all about the cut of the meat.

11,Sous Vide ribs -- can't eat for 2 days... best choice?,"Cooking ribs in the fairly new Sous Vide cooker seemed like a great idea, right up until the schedule changed and we can't eat dinner as a family tonight. Right now, the ribs are about done with the 36 hours of cooking time we'd planned on (a couple hours left). Tomorrow dinner is no good, so we're about 2 days away from being able to eat them. We know that you can cook longer than planned without any problems with Sous Vide, but an extra ***48 hours*** seems like we might be tempting fate.


Are we better off


* letting the ribs cook for another 48 hours, or
* pulling the ribs out on time and refrigerating/freezing them for the 2 days, and then finishing them in the oven right before we serve them, or
* pull the ribs out tonight, finish them in the oven, then refrigerate them for 2 days, and reheat them?


Any pro/con for those 3 options would be most helpful!


**Edit & Follow-up:**


Most. Tender. Ribs. ***EVER!***
As suggested, took the ribs out on time, chilled, and then tonight they were warmed in the sous vide cooker for about 30 minutes then finished in the oven. The meat was sliding off the bones, fork tender (for those who didn't use their fingers) and the whole family was *raving* about how awesome they were. This method is a keeper for sure!


Thanks for the advice!


",<meat><cooking-time><sous-vide>,2017-03-08 22:57:36.940,78983,20,"Pull them out on time. Cool them rapidly in an ice bath. The rapid cooling is for food safety reasons rather than any affect on the cooking. Reheat them for cooking however you were going to finish them originally. 


I wouldn't leave them cooking for 48 hours. I think you run the risk of affecting the texture of the meat negatively. 


If you're planning on finishing in the oven, I'd do that just before eating as your reheat method. You're likely to get some nice effect on the outside in terms of texture by doing that. If you refrigerate immediately after, you'll lose that benefit. So pull it out when they're done, chill, and refrigerate. To eat, let them come up to room temp a bit and then finish in the oven.

2,"Coffee roasting, worth upgrade from popcorn popper","I've been roasting for about 3 years and have gone thru about 3 or 4 poppers for roasting coffee. The machines wouldn't stop working I'd just notice they slowly started taking longer and longer to roast my coffee beans.


I've been looking at the FrenchRoast sr500 and wondering if the $170 price tag is worth it over just getting another popper. I have no complaints over the coffee I roast from the poppers other than a few gripes over the actual roasting process.


Will the FrenchRoast produce a better roast over the popcorn popper? If not is it mostly convenience? I don't have to roast outside, it has a cooling function, etc. Anything else I'm missing that can sell me on the $170 price tag?


",<coffee><roasting>,2014-07-22 15:49:24.670,45814,5,"Domestic coffee roasters are usually 'fluid-bed', barrel or 'stirrer' type.


* Popcorn poppers and most low-end purpose built roasters are fluid-bed. That is you agitate the beans by pumping hot air to roast the beans.
* Barrel types have a rotating barrel with fins inside to agitate the beans.
* Stirrer types have a pot and arms inside that are turned to stir the bean ensuring an even roast.


Upgrading from a popper to another fluid bed usually just buys you some convenience and increased roasting capacity. That being said, I had an iRoast 2 fluid-bed and that lasted at least 2 years. It was still functioning when I upgraded so it probably still works. So it may also be overall cheaper.


IMO, it's more worthwhile to upgrade to a barrel or stirrer type like the Behmor or the iCoffee. They take longer to roast, but you can achieve much better roasts and they have more capacity than fluid-beds.


**Edit: Differences between roasters**


Just a note between the differences in roasters.


Fluid-beds tend to roast very quickly. 10-15 mins total roast time. But this means that the outside of the bean roasts first and the inside is often lighter. The result is often a bit more acidic or 'bright'. The forced air however, does disperse smoke very quickly and it's a bit cleaner. It still has the capacity to set off your fire alarm.


More traditional designs tend to have longer roast times. I clock about 28 minutes. The slower process gives you a bean that has the same colour inside and out. Anecdotally, I would say most people prefer this. Many of the barrel type also produce a lot of smoke and not suitable for indoor roasting. However, the models I mentioned - the *Behmor* and the *iCoffee* - have after burners. This means they actively vent the smoke through a stage that burns up the access smoke and are suitable for indoor roasting.

Normally, if you put cookie dough on the tray, the surface of the cookie won't be very big (perhaps an inch). So it would not make a very big difference if you would've placed the cookies 4 inches apart center-to-center. Just be careful during the first batch. If you see you have a lot of space between the finished cookies, you can put the dough closer together for the next batch (if you use the same amount of dough per cookie).

16,Is hot tap water safe for cooking?,"I'll typically bring hot water from the tap to the boil instead of waiting longer for cold water. This hot water comes from water heater with a large storage tank. Is this considered safe?


For example, are heater storage tanks known for festering nasties not killed by boiling? Is different piping used for hot water or different soldering on pipe fittings? Do hot pipes cooling down go through a temperature more conducive to bacteria growth?


",<water><food-safety>,2012-02-18 01:58:27.003,21472,9,"Unless your hot water tank is very close to your hot water tap, this is a **very** energy inefficient. As Cascabel notes it would be faster to boil water in a electric kettle first, and then pour it into the pan. Put the pan on the heat at the same time if you are really in a hurry


Hot water systems are normally hot enough (above 55°C, 130°F) to keep water borne nasties at bay, plus if you are on town supply water it will be chlorinated etc


Normally on the first few meters of hot water pipe are copper, then it switched to normal crimped plastic plumbing. This will vary depending on your local building codes


The rate at which pipes lose their heat would ensure it never sits in the danger area for long, not that I think this is a big issue for clean plain water


In general, modern copper pipes are not soldered, they are crimped using special hand tools


Old or non-renovated houses may still be 100% copper pipes that have been soldered. This poses no extra safety risks with just clean water in the pipes

1,Can jams and compotes be frozen?,"Suppose that my jams and compotes are in an uninsulated, coldplace, i.e. -20°C in the winter.
Is it possible that they will be frozen, and the glass breaks, or not?


",<storage><jam>,2017-11-29 21:48:01.947,86013,3,"As you would normally fill a jar of jam only to the shoulder there should be room for expansion on freezing and most jars shouldn't crack. Jams are also <50% water, and if they contain significant pieces of fruit won't even be at the same concentration so won't freeze solid at a well-defined temperature, allowing them time to expand into the headspace.


The other main risk is thermal shock (as when you poor boiling water into a cold jar). This is unlikely except if you bring in a jar to use and put it on a hot surface or try to defrost it quickly. To be on the safe side (and, depending on your jam, to keep the colour nice) you should probably avoid direct sunlight on the jar.


A further factor to consider is loosening of the lids from freeze-thaw cycling changing the pressure inside -- expansion of the jam (water) will cause an increase in pressure at low tempertatures but the air will contract and cause a decrease. The net effect will depend on the relative volumes, the temperatures, and the rates of cooling/heating. If when the jars come back up to room tempearture, the lids are loose, the jam has probably not kept. So I suggest using proper jam jars with safety button pop-top lids so that you can tell.

0,What is the most practical pan for a deep-dish pizza,"So over the weekend I wanted to make a deep-dish pizza and ended up with a thick crust as the pan I have is only about half as deep as I would need and two inches wider than the recipe called for. For deep-dish should I bother with spending forty dollars on a black steel 2-inch high 12"" pan (that would only be used for pizza basically), or would I be better served to pay half as much for a two-inch high cast iron Lodge skillet (which would be much more versatile)?


I really like the crust you get from a heavy aluminum baking pan (thick-crust must be some kind of nostalgia thing), and already have a large stone (so good to go on thin crust), so I am looking to round out my options. Is there an alternate material or pan combination that works as well as cast-iron but might be lighter or even less expensive? 


Am I traveling the total wrong route to a great deep-dish, or do I just need some fine adjustment?

4,What are good counter-top oven settings to reheat french fries soggy from refrigerating overnight?,"I have yesterday's French Fries (Chips for those of you across the Pond). 
They were stored in a refrigerator overnight and now are cold AND soggy.


What's a good technique to reheat them in a small counter-top electrical oven? 
E.g. temperature? bake/broil/convection setting? How long?


Constraints:


* I must heat them on a sheet of thin wrapping aluminum foil (over a loose grill, no tray)
* I would prefer a method that takes less than 5 minutes, but that's not a cut-off
* The main goal is to have them somewhat crispyish on the outside, and tasty (not hard, not soggy) on the inside
* The fries/chips size can be either McDonalds size (1/2 cm^2 square cross cut) or slightly larger diner size (~0.5cm x 1 cm cross cut)
* The amount is such that - evenly spreading them on an aluminum foil sheet the size of the oven's tray - they cover pretty much the whole sheet, in single layer
* this is at work, so I am unlikely to have access to any ingredients (e.g. any answer that starts with ""sprinkle with xyz oil"" is less desirable.


The fries are fully-cooked, from an order from an eatery, not home-cooked. So while I don't know the ingredients/coating/what they were fried in, a safe assumption is that the fries are either standard McDonalds recipe, or some sort of generic US Diner or midrange restaurant recipe, assuming one is known.


",<oven><reheating><french-fries>,2015-05-28 16:02:21.920,57843,6,"They won't be as good as when fresh (of course) but generally:


1. You want the oven pretty hot. How hot depends on the oven, size of fry, etc., but a good first guess would be 425°F–450°F. On most toaster ovens I've seen, that'd be as hot as it goes. **Let the oven preheat.** Unfortunately, heating the oven is going to take longer than your five minutes, probably ten to fifteen... But as long as you stay nearby (just in case) you can do something else while its heating.
2. Spread the fries evenly on your piece of foil. Fold up the edges of the foil a little to keep them from sliding off when you move it. (Note: A plain, uncoated aluminum quarter sheet pan probably fits in your toaster oven, and can be had for under $10.)
3. They won't take long. Listen for them to start to sizzle. Once they've sizzled for a little bit (say, 30 seconds) pull them out and flip them. Put them back in and let them sizzle a little longer. Take them out, sample one, put back in if not done yet. I can't give you a time (other than ""a few minutes"") because it's going to vary a lot based on the fry, and even how much it has dried out in the fridge. *Judge when they're ready based on the sound (sizzle), smell, color (browning), and taking one out and tasting it.*


Notes:


1. You may find adding some salt helps them a lot. Same with some finely ground pepper. Or other powdered seasoning mixes like Old Bay.
2. If the center isn't warm enough by the time the outside is browning, use a lower temperature next time. If the center is overdone (e.g., dried out) before browning sets in, use a higher temperature.

Let steep for a few minutes,  

strain and throw away the mushy leaves and use the liquid for your flavoring.


The liquid will be brown as you are destroying the chlorophyll that makes the leaves green. In most applications I add food coloring to fix this. As you are making chocolate mint ice cream this should not be a problem.


Save some of your mint leaves to use as a garnish.

4,Why don't other grain proteins behave like gluten?,"There are many excellent explanations here (and elsewhere) of what gluten ""does.""


What I haven't seen anywhere is an explanation of what makes gluten so special. Where do its marvelous elastic properties come from and why don't any other grain proteins (or any other proteins anywhere, for that matter) seem to have them?


",<baking><dough><food-science><batter><chemistry>,2014-09-14 18:21:29.737,47136,5,"Your question has two main parts, what's elastic about gluten, and why don't other plants have this unicorn we call a gluten protein. I'll provide some background info first, but feel free to skip ahead to the spoilers if you like. 


**Quick and dirty background on proteins...**


All proteins (like gluten) are made of differing sequences, and number of about 20 or so basic amino acids(glutamine, lysine, cysteine, arginine, isoleucine, just to name a few). So when we talk about large proteins like gluten, it's sometimes hard to remember that chemically, we are talking about many-many amino acid (AA) molecules which link together. The way the AA's link together matters because, the chemical interactions create the overall larger shape, and helps determine the physical properties of the final protein. 


If I didn't put you to sleep, or you want to geek-out on this stuff: resources regarding the secondary(bonding between AA's which creates alpha-helices and beta-pleated sheets), tertiary (AA side chain interactions and AA's backbone), and quaternary (3D) structures of proteins, pubmed is where you need to go. 


**Glutens and what they are:**


Gluten is the main storage form of proteins in wheat. Gluten itself is a fusion of glutenin and gliadin protein units which belong to the prolamin superfamily(prolamines are cool, look them up). 


Gluten subunits fall into three broad categories:


* **High molecular weight** (HMW) prolamines, (glutenin subunits) approximately 6-10% of protein
* **Sulfur-rich prolamins** (approximately 70-80% of protein) which include: gamma-gliadins, alpha-gliadins, and the B- and C-type low molecular weight (LMW) subunits of glutenin
* **Sulfur-poor prolamins** (approximately 10-20% of protein) include:
v-gliadins, and D-type LMW subunits of glutenin


Variances in the spread of these proteins contribute to the way wheat varietals are utilized commercially(like winter or summer wheats...you have seen the variations available to buy on store shelves). The composition of gluten protein in whatever wheat strain that's being used translates into differing physical properties(elasticity, density, etc) in the dough it makes. 


**Where do the elastic properties come from?**


Elastic properties in gluten come from the way the components of the protein matrix interact with water. The gluten proteins react with water in ways that other storage forms of protein cannot, namely in the swelling/hydration bit. There are two things going on at the same time. The gliadin sections of the gluten protein contribute to the friction with which the hydrating liquid is able to move around in and near the protein matrices(viscocity). The glutenin portion of the molecule is responsible for the elasticity or strength of the protein matrix. Glutenin seems to undergo reversible (not as common as you'd hope) stretching because of the way it is folded. 


**Why don't any other grain proteins seem to have gluten?**


I would like to point out this is more of a plant physiology/phylogeny question rather than one related to cooking. 


*They just don't have what it takes.*


The way different plants create the storage form of their proteins is determined by their specific DNA sequences within the genome. AA Structure, order(N-C terminus) and final shape of the proteins created by the plant are a result of the transcription, translation and post-translational modifications of DNA sequences in the plant.

3,What is a halogen burner or (?) cooktop? How does it work?,"I often order from a restaurant supply store for commercial quality items. I just received a new fry pan and on the label it noted that it was safe for electric, gas, and halogen.


I haven't ever heard of halogen burners or cooktops. I looked up ""halogen burner"" and the results were for stand alone burners that are electric (plug in). 


So, I guess I want to know if halogen burners would have a commercial purpose and what the benefits or downsides would be. And, how do they work?


",<cookware>,2014-09-21 13:24:39.007,47292,5,"Halogen hobs are a type of electrical resistive hob which work just like a halogen incandescent bulb. In fact, the reason why incandescent bulbs are being phased out is that they are so inefficient, giving off most of the energy they use as heat instead of light. A halogen hob uses the same kind of tungsten filament as the lamps, instead of the iron found in the widespread electrical hobs. 


The benefit is that it warms up quite fast, much faster than iron. 


I haven't shopped for resistive cooktops in recent years, so I don't know how the market is. It's possible that they are very rare and expensive, or that all the new ceramic cooktops use them and the manufacturers don't mention it on the label, so the public is unaware of it. They don't work differently than standard burners, just faster, and they don't look much different from the outside. You also don't need any kind of special cookware for them, I have no idea why the manufacturer of that pan decided to tell you that it works on both ""electric"" and ""halogen"", when it is the same thing where pan suitability is concerned. 


Update as per ChrisH's comment: Because the halogen works mostly with radiant heat, it's important that you don't use a pan with mirroring bottom, that's probably why the pan was labelled as suitable for halogen besides ""electric"". This is probably important for iron-heating ceramic cooktops too, because the ceramic also lets a significant part of the iron's radiant heat through.

From the shop, you get raw grinded meat that is still good for a week. (label says so.) 


Which will last longer?  

A) The raw meat in the fridge (and prepare it when you want it.)  

B) Prepare the meal, cool it down properly and put it in the fridge.  

C) Freeze the meat and unthaw when you need it the next few days. 


(C is an extra option, as I doubt it's a handy option if you just want to prepare the meal the next day or the day after that. But again, I couldn't find any evidence back anything up.)


",<refrigerator><raw-meat>,2013-01-26 18:23:45.650,30709,1,"As for the cooked meal, it also depends on what else is in there aside from the meat. Because a meal could go bad even though the meat is still safe, because another ingridient goes bad earlier. It also depends on how you store the meal (aside from storing in the fridge) like wrapping it up in foil, putting it in a closed box, etc.


Overall I trust option B) the prepared meal in the fridge will last longer. 


This being because the former raw meat has been cooked or more basically heated above a certain critical temperature for a certain amount of time. This helps to kill bacteria which will otherwise make the meat go bad.


As for option C) Basically frozen food lasts longer than only cooled. But I wouldn't find this practical as in ""coming handy"".

This liquid, high in natural fats, could be prepared fresh whenever needed in whatever quantities. It also could be made well ahead of time and stored with no danger of degeneration.

It would take a lot of processing and additives to make the almond milk mimic those products. However, both milks contain fats, proteins, and sugars in solution, and so behave similarly enough in the chemistry of cooking to make them easy substitutes.


I will admit that while I cited medievalcookery.com and godecookery.com because the quotes were convenient, I posted my comment originally drawing from David Freedman and Elizabeth Cook's ""How to Milk an Almond, Stuff and Egg, and Armor a Turnip: A thousand years of recipes"" which is very well researched and contains a number of period citations and recipes.

8,Does blending oil (for vegan butter) make hydrogenated oil?,"I recently figured out the recipe for garlic vegan butter which is made primarily by roasting garlic, then whipping it in a blender with coconut and olive oil, and cooling in the refrigerator. It's delicious, textured similarly to butter and, as far as I know, not terribly unhealthy.


Then my father mentioned to me that that is similar to the process of making hydrogenated oils. I DO remember once reading something about whipping oil being a bad idea. Is that true? Am I basically just quaffing hydrogenated fats?


",<oil>,2012-12-02 19:17:33.260,28821,10,"Oil is hydrogenated by bubbling hydrogen through it at high temperature (on the order of 400 to 500 degrees F), in the presence of a catalyst such as nickel.


Air is 0.00005% hydrogen, you are probably not using temperatures high enough, nor doing it for a significantly long period of time, nor having an appropriate catalyst present. The amount of hydrogenation introduced via this recipe is somewhere between none and vanishingly small.


However, coconut oil itself is about 92% saturated fat--which means the fats are naturally saturated with hydrogen. While a natural saturated fat, not a manufactured one, coconut oil is saturated.


If your recipe is delicious and you enjoy it, eat up in moderation like anything else (chocolate excepted). :-)

10,"Why does my onion have very few, very thick layers, and a hollow center?","My girlfriend sliced into an onion this evening to find this,


[![weird onion](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pToRM.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pToRM.jpg)


…this is weird to me. There are very few layers, the innermost layer was exceedingly thick, and it's hollow. For reference, I'm used to an onion looking like this:


[![normal onion](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DaN9y.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DaN9y.jpg)


(apologies on the quality) Not hollow, many layers (probably like 10-12 as opposed to the weird onions 5), normal layer thicknesses.


What caused my ""weird"" onion to look the way it does? Is it safe to eat?


(Both onions looked about the same with the skin on. Not mushy, not too much damage to the outer layers, nothing to tip us off as to what we'd find…)


",<onions>,2017-05-09 06:24:29.123,81529,5,"Was this onion by any chance purchased from a local farmer's market or grower?


I have grown onions that did this, experimenting with over-wintering onions and allowing them a 2nd growth, with onions that I thought too small to harvest in fall so let them keep going. The experiment was a failure. Most rotted, but some did this, produced an onion that looked fine, but few, leathery layers and hollow or growth in the middle. Taste was fine, a bit strong, but texture was less than pleasant. Some flies and disorders like milky rot will also hollow them, but a high share of the time will also result in goo or slime and I have not seen the thick layers associated with those conditions, but that is strictly personal experience. And, it could easily be an individual mutant or bolted plant. 


Any stress while growing, too much or too little water, heat, light can cause a plant to bolt and go to full maturity before it should. In you case, to my personal eye, the onion looks like one that went to full maturity rather than a disease. We actually eat many items, like onions and garlic before they are fully mature. In both of these items, blooms are typically removed to try to delay the plant from fully maturing. This helps to produce bigger bulb and clove heads. In the case of onions, if the onion fully matures, rot occurs or a product similar to what you have. Only a guess, but what my thinking would be is an onion that was missed when top buds were removed, or one that fully matured without bothering to bloom.

1,Custard Pudding tasting like raw eggs,"So this is my first time trying to make a custard pudding(I've watched a video). And of course it came out looking horrible but I left it on the stove for 30mins. I used 2 eggs and 250ml of milk and sugar. After I took out I tried it out but it tastes a little like raw eggs. But it's slightly consistent, I am just afraid of eating it since I've read some articles about diseases that one can get from consuming raw eggs. So my question is: Is it safe to eat it knowing that it was on the stove for more than 30mins ? Although it tastes a little like raw eggs, it was hot enough to burn my tongue when I took it out of the stove.


Note: The water on the pan even boiled.

5,How do I make bread with LOTS of seeds?,"A local bread shop cooks a loaf of bread that is packed with seeds, much more than a couple tablespoons. The seeds are mixed within the matrix of the bread, plus sprinkled on top and in the baking pan.


I wanted to make a wholemeal loaf at home and add in the large amount of seeds.


Are there any modifications to the standard bread recipe I should make, or changes to cooking times?


",<bread><seeds>,2014-12-18 19:48:33.107,51728,4,"Using a large amounts of seeds will significantly influence the humidity of your dough and bread. Dry seeds will soak up quite a bit of water - either during resting time or afterwards. This is especially bad when this soaking happens *after* baking, as your bread will get very dry... Wholemeal tends to have the same effect.


The best way to counteract this effect is to


* add more water and
* add more time


This can be done either by


* pre-soaking the seeds, which will then ""bring"" the required extra water to the dough or
* letting a rather wet dough rest for a long time, preferably over night.


The first approach is easier, because the seeds take up the required water ""automatically"", the latter preferable taste-wise. Longer resting times allow for the development of complex flavors and need very little yeast or sourdough.


As for recipes, you should be able to find plenty on the internet.

I can't imagine a dish where the roux is not thoroughly heated, so unless you are pioneering some kind of cold ingredient, cold roux dish, I think you are good to go. The sealed roux in the fridge should behave like a confit and retard spoilage for a while. If you did a dark roux (like a cajun style) it should last a really long time. They sell it in jars in New Orleans supermarkets, and if memory serves, the jar said something like 90 days in the fridge after opening.

3,Baking zucchini bread without egg yolks,"I'm trying to reduce cholesterol in my diet and have switched to using egg whites (from a carton) instead of whole eggs. This substitution usually works out OK, but when I make zucchini bread -- and other quick breads -- the loaves don't rise as well as they used to, and they tend to be drier. 


I'm doing a 1:1 substitution using the guide on the carton (1egg is approx. 2oz), so I assume that a lot of the problem is that I'm missing the fat from the egg yolks. Is this correct, and if so, what can I use instead that will be low in cholesterol?


",<baking><egg-whites>,2010-07-30 22:50:52.283,3850,3,"Genetics is actually the greatest affect on cholesterol. Consumption of dietary cholesterol has very little correlation to serum cholesterol in your body and the amount of cholesterol you're going to save by leaving out the egg yolks vs. the impact it has on the resulting bread will hardly be worth it.


However, if you wish to proceed then I'd recommedn simply adding about a tablespoon of vegetable oil in replacement of the egg yolks that are being omitted.


The fat in the egg yolks is going to assist in minimizing gluten development. Since you've omitted the fat there is probably a bit more gluten formation taking place and thus the fact that it doesn't rise as well. Egg whites have a drying effect on baked goods so that is why the bread is drier than before.

Summary:


* Expiration dates are for best quality only. Nothing magical happens on that date.
* Truly fresh eggs (i.e. from the chicken) will hardly degrade at all even after a year in storage.
* Supermarket eggs are washed, removing the protective layer and lowering the shelf life.
* Some supermarket eggs are *already* contaminated with salmonella, and there's no test you can do to find out for sure (other than eating them raw). This *will* cause serious problems if you leave them in storage for several months, unless you freeze them.
* Lastly, damaged eggs will simply go rotten. You won't always see the damage, but you'll definitely smell it by the time you hit that best-before date.


As with just about every other food, you're better off interpreting the sell-by or best-before dates as a conservative guideline; any food can go off before the date if it's been damaged or mis-handled, and many foods will still be fine long after they ""expire"". [StillTasty.com](http://stilltasty.com/) is a good resource for finding out how long various foods *actually* last in storage.

8,How can I make my own small pie dishes and still cook pies effectively?,"I need to make individual pies this week. I would usually use pre-bought tin foil containers, approximately 10cm diameter, 3cm high. I can't buy these anywhere near me and have left it too late for mail-order! I also don't have any ramekins I could use in the oven. 


Has anyone got experience making their own foil pie trays? I am thinking of using a noodle bowl as a mold and just layering the foil. How many layers of foil is optimum? 


I am also worried that the pies won't have enough support while baking (they will be filled meat & gravy pies, traditional Australian style) and could burst open in my oven, so was wondering about placing them into a bed of rice/uncooked beans. Would this still allow the shortcrust pastry to cook? 


",<baking><equipment><pie>,2011-01-23 13:26:19.007,11406,7,"If you have oven safe noodle bowls (ceramic, not plastic) then line them, as you describe with the foil, but do not remove them from the bowls. Bake your pie in the lined bowls, then remove the finished pies, with their aluminum ""pan"" intact.
Or just make pasties...no pan required.


As you indicate you don't have oven safe bowls and it must be a pie, I decided to experiment, using the double foil idea. I have heavy duty foil. I used a double layer and lined a noodle bowl making sure that there was plenty of foil out past the edge. I then pressed another noodle bowl on top of the two sheets of foil to make sure all is acting as a unit. While the top bowl is still in place, crumple up the excess foil, making a rim. This is what will give you the strength you need. I would then take the top bowl out, and line the now stable foil pie tin with your pie pastry. Fill the pie and if there is a top crust, finish the pie. You can now take the pie out of the noodle bowl and bake it as usual, although I would certainly do it on a baking sheet.


The double foil is much stronger than you'd expect, but the stability comes from the rim you build with the excess foil hanging over the edge.


Here's the finished bowl with the two molding bowls.

The cheapest and simplest is to use a (cheap) electric hot air popper. The old favorite is the [West Bend Poppery](http://www.ineedcoffee.com/05/poppery/), but you can use anything as long as the vent holes (where the hot air comes in) are on the sides rather than the bottom.


I've roasted a lot of coffee this way. It works, but there are a few downsides. The biggest problems:


* The circuation is designed for popcorn, which expands a lot more than roasted coffee beans. I've needed to stir the beans manually in order to get an even roast. They don't have to be stirred constantly, but you can't just drop the beans in and walk away.
* The capacity is pretty low, especially when you take the circulation into account. I can only roast a half a cup at a time, which is pretty slow.
* The temperature doesn't get quite high enough to really bring the flavors out. The roast is good, but it's really mellow.

Some methods have you roasting the coffee in your kitchen - in the oven, on the stove, etc. I wouldn't want to do this myself, for two reasons.

Exactly how big are the pieces? How precisely can you measure and maintain the temperature of the oven or cooking medium?


What you need to be sure that your chicken is perfectly done is an instant read thermometer. At first, aim for 165F (74C), that's the minimum ""safe"" temperature. After that, you may choose to go a little higher, especially for dark meat. Some people prefer a few degrees lower, especially for breasts. Whether temperatures under 165F are safe is a bit controversial, you need to assess any risk on your own. Once you know the exact temperature that seems perfect for you, that's where to aim. The temperature will continue to rise after you remove the chicken from the heat. For small pieces that ""carry-over"" temperature rise will be pretty negligible; a whole chicken will rise a few degrees. 


Whatever recipe you follow, take the temperature a few minutes before the time in the recipe. As you gain experience, you'll get better at zeroing in on doneness by appearance.

15,Can one become ill from consuming food smoked with wood that contains a common fungus?,"If someone used common wood (oak, hickory, etc) from the woodpile, which had been sitting in the rain and weather for some moderate time and, consequently, may be harboring some common fungi, could the smoke from such wood, deposited on food, cause illness?


",<food-safety><smoking>,2013-06-21 13:21:15.163,36220,6,"The first thing I would suggest is finding a copy of ""Food and Beverage Mycology, 2nd. Edition"" by Larry R. Beuchat.

However, in order to specifically answer the question, one would need to be familiar with three additional chapters: 50 pages of classification of yeast and molds at the beginning of the book, and two equally substantial chapters on detection of mycotoxins and fungi.


Without identifying the exact species of fungus on the wood, and therefore what particular toxins it may produce (many produce toxins that are harmful to us, some produce ones that are only harmful to other fungi), it is impossible to say that it is safe to smoke with this wood. Some of the toxins may be degraded by heat, some may become even more hazardous. Even with all of my equipment in my ""kitchen lab"" (including an incubator that I use for growing edible fungi), I would just use the mold-covered wood for a nice fire around which my neighbors could gather and share some barbecue smoked on clean, dry wood (scientific studies show that soaking wood does not actually do anything but get the very outside layer wet).

16,Use Avocado instead of Butter to bake a cake?,"This may sound extravagant, but I have tried a very nice chocolate pudding made of avocado, chocolate, and some other ingredients. You could not tell there was avocado in the pudding and the texture was just perfect!


So I was wondering if avocado can be used instead of butter to bake cakes too.


Has anyone tried this before?


",<substitutions><butter><avocados>,2011-06-17 20:06:28.823,15572,21,"There are two things you care about when you are making a cake. First, ratio. Second, sequence. 


The ratio is a weight ratio. For example, a muffin batter has 2 parts flour, 2 pars liquid, 1 part egg, and 1 part fat. You can use different types of liquid to make different kinds of muffins. You can make any amount of batter you want, provided you use the same ratio.\* 


The second point is the sequence of combining the ingredients. Look at pound cake and sponge cake: they are made with the same ingredients, using exactly the same ratio. But you combine the ingredients in a different order, producing two different types of cake layer. 


If you decide to change a recipe for avocado baking, you must keep both ratio and sequence in mind. An avocado contains, on average, [15% fat and 74% water by mass](http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/2205). It also has 7% fiber, but as I assume that you'll puree the avocado first, it shoudln't roughen the cake too much, it will be nowhere like whole wheat cake. We can ignore the sugars (1%) and proteins (2%), as the amount is insignificant. 


As for the ratio, you can try using avocado, and then removing some fat and liquid from the cake recipe. As fresh avocado has 5 times more water than butter, it isn't possible to substitute all the butter from the original recipe - I don't know any cake recipes with such high water:butter ratios. You should rather replace the liquid, calculate how much butter is being replaced by avocado fat, and then add the remaining butter needed. It will still need fine tuning, because some of the avocado water is already trapped in the fiber, and won't hydrate the cake flour. I'd try out using maybe 140-160 g avocado puree for each 100 g liquid in the recipe. This will result in 115-120 g. avocado water. It will also deliver 20 g fat. So for aforementioned cupcakes, we'll only need 5 g additional fat (they use 25 g fat per 100 g liquid). Of course, layers for sponge cake or sachertorte are out of the question, because they don't use liquid in the first place. 


The second problem is the sequence. Some recipes expect you to cream the butter and sugar. These can't be made with avocado, as it is impossible to separate the fat and liquid in this case. Similarly, you can't use it to make a roux for a souffle (OK, that's not technically a cake). Other recipes don't require such careful mixing methods, and they should be fine with avocado puree. You can try practically anything where you are supposed to dump all liquid ingredients together, mix, and add the dry ones at once. 


Of course, you want also to consider the taste. Avocado has a somewhat earthy taste, and you'll probably notice it in a baked product. So fine cakes (like chiffon cake) are better off with butter. But most of those are made without liquid anyway. You can try to hide the taste in cakes which have a very strong taste of their own. Chocolate batters will be very good for this, but some flourless cake bases with a significant share of ground nuts should work too. Another option is to use avocado in some more hearty, heavy cakes, where the taste isn't a problem. It should function in sweet cakes, and will probably be perfect in savory cakes (think zucchini & bacon cupcakes). It would be interesting to see what happens to a flaky crust where avocado puree is used instead of water (with butter accordingly reduced). If the texture remains OK, it should give a very nice note to quiches. 


If you replace a sour liquid with avocado (e.g. yogurt or buttermilk), don't use baking soda. If the recipe calls for it, use baking powder instead, because baking soda needs acidic ingredients for its leavening action.

4,How to honey roast peanuts?,"<http://m.wikihow.com/Make-Honey-Roasted-Peanuts>


Here it is mentioned that peanuts should not be raw. Why?


When I will put them in the oven, they will get roasted. Why does that link want me to not use raw peanuts?


",<peanuts>,2014-12-27 03:20:46.993,52021,4,"For sure, @TFD is correct that you should be wary of Wikihow - in the link you shared, the proportions of ingredients listed at the top don't appear to match the actual amounts of ingredients shown in the pictures.


""Honey Roasted Peanuts"" is a catch-all phrase that is used to describe just about any type roasted peanuts in a candy coating. The catch-all extends to recipes that don't even call for much honey (typically a touch of honey and a bunch of sugar) and to recipes that don't even call for much roasting.


To get roasted peanuts in a candy coating using an oven, you either have to roast-then-coat or you have to coat-then-roast. The primary difference is oven time. If you use cooked peanuts, you only need to cook the coated nuts long enough for the candy coating to bake onto the peanut - you're just honey-glazing the peanuts - they won't be in the oven nearly as long as they would be if you were roasting raw nuts. It's a fairly quick process that's easy enough to gauge by sight. Technically, you'd be roasting the honey coating onto the nuts - not roasting the raw nuts in honey.


Note - Planters nuts are labeled as ""Dry *Roasted* Honey *Roasted* Peanuts"" - the peanuts are dry-roasted first then coated then roasted again. Also, for what it's worth, the ingredients list shows they contain more sugar than honey by weight: <http://www.planters.com/varieties/nutrition-information.aspx?Site=1&Product=2900007345> .


If you use raw peanuts, you would need to keep them in the oven long enough for the peanuts to roast as well. Given the oven time your link recommends, raw peanuts would not cook - so that would be one fundamental reason why your link specifies that you *not* use raw peanuts. Potential flaws of Wikihow aside, your link proposes a way to roast honey onto nuts, not a way to roast nuts using honey.


You can certainly honey-roast raw peanuts using more time in the oven - but the timing could present problems with the coat-then-roast method. The candied coating is going to brown as your mixture cooks in the oven making it difficult to visually gauge when your formerly raw peanuts have cooked sufficiently (or if they are cooking evenly). Also, you should be aware that once nuts are cooked and hot, it is very easy for them to go from done to burnt in very little time - it is probably pretty easy to burn your mix if you overshoot the roasting. It would definitely be easier to determine when a honey glaze has roasted onto cooked nuts than it would be to know when raw nuts were finished cooking in a glaze.


But if raw peanuts are easier to come by or if you want to have literally roasted honeyed peanuts, it's definitely possible but I would recommend looking to a more reputable source for guidance (especially for cooking time). And once you start roasting your mix, stir/rearrange the nuts thoroughly and frequently to insure even cooking and to keep burning at bay.

13,How to keep fresh-squeezed fruit juice?,"Is there any way to keep fresh-squeezed fruit juice (especially apple or orange) for at least one week without losing taste and vitamins in it? Would a jar with a tight lid be useful?


",<storage-method><fruit><juice>,2011-12-10 23:52:07.200,19572,16,"Some quick research indicates there are enzymes in freshly-squeezed juice that will degrade it fairly rapidly, and that they can be deactivated by heat. Of course, that also changes the flavor (especially since you're not going to be able to quickly heat and cool it, as it apparently only takes 30 seconds, but any method doable in a home kitchen will keep it hot much longer than that). So heat-deactivation is out.


Even commercially-produced (that is, both pasteurized and enzyme-deactivated) juice is only supposed to keep 6 days in the fridge, so that's out.


Your best bet, then, is to freeze it. According to the University of California's Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources [Publication 8199](http://homeorchard.ucdavis.edu/8199.pdf), you can freeze in clean glass jars or rigid plastic freeze containers. They also note that navel oranges (and their juice) do not freeze well—they will become bitter.


Well, either that, or store the fruit instead, and only juice it as needed.

6,Is it safe to eat pumpkins grown specifically for carving?,"As it is coming up to Halloween, there is an abundance of cheap pumpkins in the shops now. I quite like to eat pumpkin rather than carve them. Are the large round orange pumpkins good to eat are are they just grown (with lots of nasty chemicals/fertilizer) to only be used as carved lanterns? From the outside, the shell seems very hard so maybe they will be quite tough. I would more than likely roast the flesh and use it for soup.


**UPDATE**


From the two other related questions highlighted by @Jefromi, one referenced this [article](http://www.ochef.com/847.htm) that states:


*""All pumpkins may be eaten, but there is a big difference among varieties. Decorative pumpkins, which American children and patient parents carve just before Halloween, are grown with color, structural strength, a flat bottom, and a sturdy stem as their main attributes. The flesh tends to be bland, watery, and fibrous. No one cares because they're going to be carved and smashed in the street (or disposed of properly).""*


So from that I would assume that the decorative pumpkins are not very good to eat.


",<food-safety><pumpkin>,2010-10-27 13:42:52.213,8579,6,"Safe? Or good to eat? Pesticides usually don't penetrate thick-skinned produce (oranges, etc), so as long as you're not using the skin, there's not a lot to worry about.


They're not the best pumpkins to use for other reasons (linked in comments). In summary, the smaller ""sugar"" pumpkin is better for cooking, if you have the option.

5,"Stew in the oven or on the stove, does it make a difference?","What is the advantage (if any) of finalizing a stew or other slow-cooked meals in the oven instead of on a hob?


A lot of recipes tells you to set the pot in the oven to cook for *x* hours after the initial frying has been done on the stove. Why is that, couldn't you just as easily cook it at a low temperature on a hob for the same period of time? 


The only advantage I can see is that the dish maybe doesn't burn as easily when cooked in the oven.


",<oven><slow-cooking><stove><stews>,2012-08-17 14:47:16.297,25716,9,"In the oven, that heat is coming from all directions more or less equally. On the stovetop, the heat is coming only from the bottom. This can potentially cause convection, and almost certainly requires occasional stirring (especially for larger batches), meaning that the ingredients are being moved around. The combination of the ingredients being heated more when they're at the bottom and the movement can cause them to start breaking apart, and generally cook unevenly.


Personally, I only find this to be an issue with beans and meat (and it's not something that's going to cause failure; it's really just a refinement) but if you are making an especially large batch of stew, you may want to try the oven.

-3,What are the alternatives to fresh apple juice?,"My doctor has told me to drink fresh apple juice in the morning.
I am finding it difficult to drink fresh fruit juice daily.


Is there anything available in the market which I can keep in the refrigerator and drink?


The nutritional value should be the same or less but not much less.


I have heard that normal apple juice from the market has no [nutritional?] value to drink.


",<food-preservation><juice><juicing>,2012-11-29 05:05:10.967,28750,7,"No, you cannot substitute *fresh* apple juice. 


Some of the compounds found in apple juice are very volatile. They evaporate a few minutes after the juice is made, or are broken down by still-active enzymes or oxygenation. These processes don't happen in the whole apple, because these compounds don't come into contact with the wrong enzymes or oxygen before juicing. But they start as soon as the juice is made. 


As the enzymes would change the juice too much, and as a measure against bacteria, you cannot keep pressed apple juice in the refrigerator for more than a few hours. It would perish too soon to be brought into the market. Thus, apple juice sold in the market is *pasteurized*, which means heated. The heating destroys further compounds in the juice, which weren't destroyed by the enzymes and oxygen. Many vitamins can be destroyed during the pasteurization, and possibly other ""healthy"" compounds. 


What is left is still rich in nutrients. The fructose and malic acid stay there for certain, as well as lots of aromatic components (but not all of them). Some vitamins will also remain after the pasteurization, but not all. 


So, if you really need the fresh stuff, you cannot substitute it. Even juicing it yourself the night before will reduce its quality. But as SAJ14SAJ said, we don't know why the doctor prescribed you fresh juice, maybe all you need is the quickly available fructose. You can ask him if the pasteurized juice from the market will do. Another option is, if pressing juice is logistically too hard for you early in the morning, to ask if you can eat the whole apple. Again, this depends on what you need the juice for, so we cannot answer here, only the doctor can.

4,Why does this sunflower butter exude green liquid?,"The most recent brand of sunflower butter (Mara Natha) that I've been using left a green tinted liquid inside the glass jar after I attempted to wash it out for recycling with water ~200°F/93°C and left the water in over night. 


The liquid was not just floating oil on top, but a consistent transparent green, close to the darker green check of the cooking.se background.


I washed it out again, and the second time I just rinsed with warm tap water and left it again as an experiment this time, and it was a lightly tinged yellow color that one would expect/imagine would be left since that is close to the color of the oil that separates out before you mix it in.


Note, there is a bit of sea salt in the mixture of this one. Also, the sunflower seeds are listed as being roasted beforehand. This is not an organic product.


I thought, just maybe, I could have 'burned' the sunflower oil, so I checked around and found [This page](http://www.goodeatsfanpage.com/CollectedInfo/OilSmokePoints.htm), that lists many different smoking points for the same oils and redundant and various stages of 'refinement.' However, the water was no longer boiling, and the lowest listed temp was 225°F/107°C on the various sources cited. I would think that a roasted sunflower seed would qualify as 'more refined' and therefore increase the smoking temperature of the oil crushed from it.

1,Did I kill my chili's heat by processing the tomatoes and onions together?,"I made this chili: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ9eY0_DoEk>


I ended up with a chili that, while robust, only gave a mild heat and a heavy tomato/meat flavor, even after excessive salting and peppering. This recipe has two whole jalapeños and half a habanero, so I am not positive this is intended.


There's a few things that could have gone wrong. First, I have never made chili from scratch, so I may have simply under-cooked it. Also, I accidentally added 2 tbsp cornmeal to the spice paste. But, I feel like these are unlikely.


The last difference is what I suspect to be my culprit - I had to blend the tomatoes and onions together in a food processor, due to somebody in the household being a picky eater who can't stand the texture of them. I added it in around the point the tomatoes are added in the recipe, opting to add only the peppers and garlic where the onions would have also been added. 


Did this kill my chili's heat? And, if so, how do I avoid this from happening if I make it again? Or did something else do it? Am I missing something?


",<flavor><tomatoes><onions><spicy-hot><chili>,2018-10-06 01:20:47.047,92704,6,"So, first, that chili recipe will *always* be heavily meat-flavored because it has 3lbs of beef in it; at a glance, that recipe is more than half beef by weight. So if you want a recipe with a subtler meat flavor, that's probably not the right recipe for you.


There are several possible reasons for it being less spicy than you expected, among which are:


* the dried anchos and cascabel you used were old and had lost most of their flavor
* heat level in fresh peppers can vary a lot; maybe you got ones that were on the less-hot side for their variety
* many fresh peppers vaporize a lot of their capsaicin when fried. So it's possible that adding just the peppers and garlic to the pan could have burned a bunch off; I've had this happen particularly with habaneros


All of that aside, I wouldn't expect that recipe to be super-spicy, more medium-hot. So maybe you just have a high pepper tolerance.

",<baking><cake><batter>,2012-02-26 01:24:38.127,21734,6,"Milk won't help you - it's mostly water, and gluten develops from flour (more accurately, specific proteins in flour) and water.


The way to reduce gluten development is to incorporate more fat into the batter. Lipids are hydrophobic and will prevent further hydration of the glutenin.


Using a lower-protein flour will also help. If you're not already using cake flour, the reason it's called cake flour is because of the lower protein content.


That being said, have you actually tried leaving the batter coarse? Just because the batter is lumpy does not mean that the cake will have big lumps. The entire mixture is wet, so unless you leave *huge* lumps of dry flour in the batter, you won't end up with a lumpy *cake*. There's a difference between ""don't overmix"" and ""don't mix"" - you're supposed to mix enough to incorporate, just don't try homogenize it.

If the jam has less sugar (1:2 are popular, 1:3 are found sometimes), then you have to either can it, or keep it in the fridge and consume it within a few days, similar to any other cooked food. Else, you are colonizing bacteria in your jam, and at some point, some of them will happen to be pathogenic and cause some unpleasant disease in whoever eats the jam. 


Canning is a process in which the jam is closed against any new bacteria (that's why you have to close the jar hermetically) and then heated enough that most old bacteria are killed. After canning, you can keep the closed jars at room temperature without any new bacteria developing.

He had learned to mix everything, knead fully then for the last minute add salt.


Can someone suggest the pros and cons of the two tactics? 


",<bread><dough>,2013-07-20 20:40:09.937,35431,5,"Salt has an effect on the enzymes in flour, as well as how the water affects gluten development and yeast activity. Generally when salt is added later in the mixing process, it is to allow more time for enzymatic processes to happen before the salt inhibits them. (Alternately, you can add salt at the very beginning with all the other ingredients as long as it doesn't come in contact with fresh yeast.) 


Kneading dough without salt can help the gluten to develop faster, and give you a very smooth, extensible dough. The problem is that then you have to knead dry salt into a developed dough, which can be pretty hard to do.


Letting the dough sit without salt (called an autolyse) allows for enzymes to do most of the gluten development work before you start actually kneading it, letting it form a developed dough very quickly. The advantage of this is that the dough is not yet fully developed when you add the salt, so it's a lot easier to get it incorporated.

So since conversion occurs at a relatively low temperature, the resulting batter spreads prior to setting.""


The problem is that shortening melts at a higher temperature than butter and so cookies made with shortening typically rise **more** than butter made cookies. Thus your rising problems are probably not caused by the type of fat.


I suspect that the temperature of your fat might be causing the problem. If your butter came from the fridge and the shortening was room temperature then the shortening cookies would melt faster and rise less.

6,Cooking one-handed: things to watch out for,"I'm temporarily without the use of my left, non-dominant, hand (broken shoulder after a bike crash). Obviously my cooking will be rather limited but I still want to make some home made food. What should I be careful of?


I'm mainly thinking of main meals - baking is right out. For example a veggie chilli. Safety is my main concern, but I wouldn't want to be stuck with something I couldn't move half cooked. 


Some things I've thought of:


* plan how to avoid moving heavy dishes
* don't reckon on chopping hard veg, or veg that rolls (buy frozen ready-chopped etc. when possible)
* everything will take longer


But I'm sure I've missed a lot, the question is what. 


",<knife-skills>,2019-06-27 14:07:31.490,99798,4,"I can give some general recommendations, but if I had some specific recipes that you were considering, I might be able to give more specific recommendations.


First, I'd avoid using any tool that I can't clean one-handed. If you have a dish-washer, this might not be a problem, but even things like a blender you might have difficulty disassembling and re-assembling one handed, as you can't screw on/off the bottom. Likewise, most jars and screw-top bottles will be a problem.


There are [items that can be mounted under a cabinet to help with opening screw-tops](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B01GEVLJPI), but most of them are only intended for opening ... they wouldn't work for closing the jar after you've used it. (and they'd be almost impossible to install one-handed. VHB or other mounting tape *might* work, but they tend to fail in torsion, so you'd need to stick the perimeter down well, and maybe add a nail or screw to prevent rotation))


Canned items are likewise out, unless you have an electric can-opener. (that being said -- check thrift stores. They often show up there). It *might* be possible to use an old school [claw-style can opener](https://homequicks.com/types-of-can-openers) opener on larger cans, but smaller cans are just going to move around on you too much. The ones built into pocket knives *might* work better, as they have a little bit that catches underneath can lip, but getting the tool opened one-handed is going to be a problem.


I would invest in some 'non-slip' shelf liner. (I like the stuff that seems to be a grid of drops of rubber. ([This stuff might be it](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B00PY3IA4Q), but I couldn't be absolutely sure from the picture.) It could be placed under bowls that you can't stabilize with your off hand while you mix things, and it *might* work to place in the sink so that you can scrub a pot one-handed.


This is going to be counter-intuitive, but I'd actually use heavier pans. You want something that's not going to move around on the stove as you're trying to stir things or scrape up fond when deglasing. This might also be a good time to [learn how to flip your food one-handed](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/11170/67).


You can avoid some heavy lifting by only moving empty pots & pans:


* Put the empty vessel on the stove
* Fill the vessel
* Ladle cooked food out of the vessel
* Move the empty vessel to the sink (or dishwasher) to clean it


If you have tongs, you can also do this with strand-type pasta, and if you have a good spider you can make shaped pasta. (I prefer a basket-style spider, as I don't take so long to get it all out that half of it is overcooked). You can use a pitcher to get the water into the pot, and a large pyrex measuring cup to get most of it out. (or wait for it to cool, and use whatever you have that you can dip in).


You can avoid some knife work by using ground meats. (if you're a meat-eater. If not, well, avoid large blocks of firm tofu) This will both avoid cutting while cooking, but also while eating. If you *do* need to cut things up, I'd recommend kitchen scissors. You can use them to cut up cooked meats, but they fail at things like cutting up peppers and onions. (although they might be okay for green onions / scallions)


I would actually avoid anything large that you'd have to move while hot. This would include casseroles. If you really want to make something like that, I'd invest in some serving-sized ramekins and make individual portions. (and possibly put a silicone pot-holder under the ramekin when eating)


You also have to consider eating -- you might be able to cook a steak one-handed, but you're not going to be able to eat it easily. If you're a meat eater, I'd probably work with boneless, skinless chicken thighs. They're relatively easy to cook one-handed with tongs, and you can easily cut them up with scissors or turn them into shredded chicken with a potato masher. (and they're way more difficult to overcook than breasts)




---


This could also be a good time to call on your friends, and or make some new friends. (This might work as a pick-up line ... approach someone you're interested in, and ask them if they'd help you cook in exchange for cooking lessons and/or a meal. If you do this, I'd suggest asking them what foods they like).


You could use your friends for some partial meal prep ... things like dicing or slicing up peppers, onions, or other ingredients so you'll have them for later meals. Or you could look into making a few single-serve casseroles (large casseroles are going to be impossible to move one-handed) or other dishes that just need to be re-heated so you have meals for a few days. If you go the second route, you can also send the friend home with a few meals in exchange.

5,Why do fatty foods go with sour ones?,"Why do fatty foods tend to go with acids?


Mayonnaise and hollandaise contain lemon juice, and fatty fish tends to be served with lemon. Barbecue pork and pork belly are sometimes served with a vinegar-based sauce. I've also heard that fatty foods should be paired with acidic wines.


Is there something about the way we taste fat or the way we digest it that makes us crave sourness?


",<fats><acidity><pairing>,2011-03-02 01:26:36.540,12702,6,"In regards to the general question, our brains are wired to like fats; they are compact sources of energy.

I believe (by which I mean this is what I think, with no evidentiary basis whatsoever) this is a learned response, but I could very well be wrong.


The pairing of acids with fish, however, does have a scientific basis. According to [the bible](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0684843285):

",<cookies><convection>,2015-03-03 18:53:05.197,55358,6,"Lots of people bake very good cookies without convection ovens, so it's certainly possible. :)


If the bottoms of your cookies are burning/overbaking, the first thing to try is a lighter-colored cookie sheet. Sometimes, even just using some white parchment paper on a dark cookie sheet can help, but the best is to invest in a shiny, light-colored metal cookie sheet, perhaps even an insulated one (i.e. one with two layers of aluminum with an air core in between).


Also, get a good oven thermometer, and make sure your oven is actually at the temperature suggested by the recipe.


If your oven has the heating element in the bottom (which is most of them), try putting the cookies higher up in the oven - not necessarily way up at the top, but just above the middle rather than just below.

7,Why did my lids seal?,"This has never happened to me before! Last night I made Refrigerator Pickles using cucumbers and an ordinary vinegar, water, sugar brine. My intention was to make a couple jars for co-workers who would use them within a few weeks.


I sterilized my jars, lids, and rings but didn't keep the jars hot. The brine simmered but never boiled and was allowed to cool down quite a bit (not completely cool to room temperature and still warm). I filled the jar with my vegetables and added the warmish brine. Then I added hot lids (I was simultaneously actually canning apple butter so they were simmering), sealed with rings, and set aside to cool. Within just a few minutes I heard the lovely popping sound all canners long for! 


I don't trust it for long term storage since I didn't go through the actual entire canning process. Once the jars cooled to room temperature, I put them in the refrigerator; this morning, I tested the lids and they are in fact sealed. Are they safe for long-term refrigerator storage?

7,Is leaving a Teflon rice cooker on overnight dangerous?,"I own a cheap Rival brand rice cooker. [Here is a link to the product page.](http://www.rivalproducts.com/cooking/rice-cookers/CKRVRCM063.html#start=2) Note that there is an inner removable bowl where the rice is cooked. This bowl is coated in Teflon.


After cooking rice last night, I forgot to turn the cooker off, although it automatically switches to a 'warm' setting after the rice is done. (The two settings can be seen in the product page linked above.) I forgot to unplug the cooker, and it remained on overnight (8-9 hours) in a small, poorly ventilated apartment. Should I be worried at all about possible Teflon fumes? The bowl was only mildly warm when I found it in the morning, and there was no evidence of burning. I was under the impression that Teflon is only dangerous at very high temperatures, but I wanted to be sure.


More generally, suppose I want to start making rice at lunchtime so that I have warm rice ready for me when I come home. Is it safe to leave the cooker on for this period of time? 


",<rice-cooker><teflon>,2013-09-12 13:45:55.907,36740,6,"There is no risk to the Teflon itself, or from it; PTFE breaks down at about 500 F, which rice cookers will not achieve, especially on warming setting. Other than that, PTFE is one of the most inert substances known to man, as the atoms are already bound in energetically very favorable bonds: little is as able to displace them without significant input energy (thus the high breakdown temperature).


On the other hand, you should not hold rice for a long time without either refrigerating it, or having it above 140 F (60 C) as there is some risk of [Bacillus cereus](http://www.foodsafety.gov/poisoning/causes/bacteriaviruses/bcereus) growing and causing food borne illness.

The principles remain the same for grilling or barbecuing: you want to cook the squid briefly so it doesn't toughen up, or slowly for a long time, so that the collagen dissolves to gelatin, making the squid tender again. In between is the rubbery zone.


The main issue is that many squid are not really large enough to place directly on a grill grate without danger of falling through, so you may wish to use a fish or vegetable grilling grate. You can then grill them briefly, over high heat.


It is probably possible to use low-and-slow smoking techniques (true barbecuing), but I didn't find any really credible sources or recipes, and I have never tried this myself. You could also grill the squid to get some smokey flavor, then finish by braising them (for example, in a disposable pie tin on the cool side of your grill, with flavorful liquid) for a long time.


Googling [barbecued squid recipe](https://www.google.com/search?q=barbecued+squid+recipe) will give you many recipes to try, with a variety of marinades and treatments.

2,Why do small things taste better than big things?,"Small berries have more flavor than large berries, small scallops have more flavor than large scallops, cherry tomatoes have more flavor than beefsteak tomatoes.

",<food-science><ingredient-selection>,2020-06-27 22:50:00.143,109349,3,"A few factors are in play here (and these probably aren't all of them). I'll stick mainly to fruits (in a rough botanical sense) but some of this will generalise more widely.


Many commercial varieties have been bred for yield (as expressed by weight) and appearance. This is likely to have come at the expense of other variables, such as flavour. This leaves room in the market for tastier varieties, even if smaller or a less attractive colour or shape.


For a given variety of some fruits, water uptake can make a big difference. I have wild blackberries at the bottom of my garden, and don't water them. In a wet year they're juicy but not very tasty. In a dry year, they've got plenty of flavour, but they're hard - good for cooking with apples but not for just eating. I'll try to track down an article I read on arid agriculture - careful minimal irrigation could produce a premium flavour but a low yield. In the mean time [here's](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/28/to-grow-the-tastiest-herbs-treat-them-mean-says-james-wong) an article coincidentally published today saying the same for herbs.


Some fruits stop growing long before they ripen, while others don't. This, combined with the timing of water availability and sunshine when needed for ripening, will affect the concentration of flavour compounds produced during ripening.

Use equal amounts of ginger to substitute for galangal. And yes, it is the best substitute available from your average non-Asian grocery store.


If you can get your hands on dried, powdered galangal, however, you can do better. Add about half the amount of ginger, and around midway through cooking add a teaspoon of powdered galangal for every tablespoon of fresh in the recipe. The combination of fresh ginger and powdered galangal will be very close to fresh galangal in flavor.


Also, if you make a field trip to an Asian market, peeled galangal cut into chunks freezes quite well.

20,Unexplained Butterflied Roast Chicken Success,"Yesterday I started working on a six pound butterflied roast chicken a little too close to an evening meeting. I [butterflied](http://theitaliandish.blogspot.com/2009/03/spatchcock-chicken.html) the chicken and patted it as dry as possible inside and out with paper towels. I then mixed up some olive oil, lemon juice, salt, cracked pepper, chili powder, onion powder, and cumin and liberally applied it all over the skin. I'm not sure I really managed to completely flatten the chicken, as I'm fairly weak and it was a large bird, so the butterfly technique wasn't perfect. I put it under a pre-heated broiler and started out following [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/magazine/30food-t-001.html) recipe, with the chicken cooking for about 6 minutes skin-side up, then 6 minutes meat-side up, then I put the oven on 375 degrees F (190.5 degrees C) with the chicken skin side up. Ever time I flipped it I poured some of the collected juices over the bird. Because the bird was so big, it wasn't done after about an hour of cooking when I needed to leave, so I put the broiler on low for about 3 minutes before leaving, and then I shut the oven off to keep from charring my chicken and burning the place down. At this point the thigh was around 140 degrees F at the thickest part. I was gone for about an hour.


When I returned, my spouse didn't want to eat the chicken until we'd verified that it had come to temperature, so we turned the oven back on to 400 degrees F (204.4 degrees C) for a few more minutes. The bird went way beyond minimum temperature - the thickest part of the thigh was well over 175. I expected it to taste disgustingly dry.


Instead what we had was the most moist, tender roasted chicken I've ever had. The skin was crispy, the meat fell off the bone (literally when we moved it off the rack).


What was it about this accidental cooking method that worked so well? Did the time in the hot-but-not-on oven do anything? Was it just the initial recipe and the size of the bird? The basting? I'd love to reproduce the flavor and texture of my chicken, but do I need all the accidental steps?


",<chicken><roasting>,2010-10-20 12:55:59.263,8343,9,"I suspect you may have created a poor-man's slow-cooking environment in there. You had meat, and liquid, and a median temperature of around 200° F, and you probably also got the bird *close* to ""done"" during the first broil, before you even left the house. This is obviously easier to do when the meat is covered (was it in a covered roasting pan?) due to the steam, but the oven does provide some insulation to begin with.


Technically when slow-cooking you should theoretically be able to speed up the process by quickly bringing the meat up to just below doneness/moisture-loss temperature (130° F) and then switching to a moisture-preserving slow-cook method like braising. I think that's what you accidentally did, but it's hard to say for because nobody was there for an hour and it sounds like you didn't check the temperature *before* the second round in the oven.


My guess is that the second roast at 400° F was probably unnecessary, and that the bird was already done, having been cooked in a very slow roast.


I'm pretty sure it *wasn't* the basting that helped. It seems to be [regarded as a myth](http://www.practicallyedible.com/edible.nsf/pages/basting) these days that basting keeps the meat moist, because the baste really doesn't penetrate the skin (and it's not the skin you're worried about). Basting is done to add flavour, not preserve moisture.


The recipe itself also doesn't strike me as anything special in terms of keeping the bird moist, aside from having a relatively short cooking time (as with any grilling/broiling) and letting the meat rest afterward, neither of which really apply in your case. It was probably the slow heat that did it.

2,Which kind of mortar and pestle replaces a blender?,"I can't stand the noise, and even just the idea, of a blender in my kitchen. I want to keep things more natural (less plastic) and waste free (less products).


So I was looking into getting a mortar and pestle instead. I stumbled onto a great looking olive wood one but after reading the answers to [this question](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/13928/is-there-a-downside-to-using-a-wood-mortar-and-pestle/13942#13942) I'm not sure it's what I'm looking for.

I can't imagine every chef as every kind.


In the best of worlds I want to crush spices and herbs, make sauces, grind seeds and nuts, pound garlic and ginder, and maybe even make some soups. Which kind of mortar and pestle would be most versatile in this case?


",<equipment><mortar-and-pestle>,2019-06-26 16:04:14.767,99778,4,"As usual, Serious Eats has an article for this, [covering what type of M&P to buy](https://www.seriouseats.com/2018/08/best-mortars-and-pestles.html). They recommend a large granite model for most purposes, but an olivewood or marble one for certain special foods, like pesto.


Your question is specifically ""replacing a blender"", though, and ""even make some soups"". An M&P will never replace a blender for pureeing liquids. First, you can't put much liquid in even the largest countertop M&P, no more than a liter. Second, M&Ps do not work for pureeing liquids, but rather for grinding dry ingredients. If you were to put a chunky soup in, and try to pound it, the soup would just splash all over the counter. And forget trying to make frozen drinks like daquiris in one.


All is not lost, though: you can pretty much handle almost all foods if you combine an M&P with a stick blender. Yes, it's still a blender, but it's smaller, quieter and more economical. The only thing you won't be able to do is the frozen drinks.

4,Potatoes in bread? How to estimate potatoes needed?,"Just found out that adding potato to a bread recipe can make it softer and more moist. I'd like to experiment with this. If I were following a recipe that didn't include potatoes, how could I modify it to include potatoes? Do the potatoes need to be a certain percentage of the flour? Do I add more liquids along with the potato? Do I remove some flour and replace with potatoes?


Also, will potato flakes work as well?

Take a recipe you like that could use a bit more moistness. Throw in a cup of baked potato. Remove a half-cup of flour and 1/4 cup of whatever liquid you're using. You can also try using Potato flour:

16,How hot does garlic need to get to lose its sharpness?,"Inspired by the recent questions here, I made manicotti over the weekend. The recipe I used called for minced garlic in the filling. I love garlic and usually put in at least double recipe-prescribed dosage.


After baking for about half an hour the cheese was completely melted and the filling was set to my satisfaction. The garlic, however, was not sufficiently cooked and, although minced fine, was still caused some bites to be unpleasantly sharp. I wish that I had roasted the garlic in advance.


The question is twofold:


* How hot does garlic need to get to be
cooked? That is, sweet and not sharp.
* Is there a better way besides
pre-roasting to ensure that garlic in
such a dish does not distract?


",<garlic><temperature>,2010-10-04 20:24:26.833,7838,8,"I can't give a specific temperature, as there's issues:


* The sharpness is a chemical reaction which mix when the garlic cells are damaged.
* Cooking the garlic before damaging the cells will convert the chemicals before they've had a chance to react.
* Cooking the garlic after the chemical reaction will also remove the sharpness.
* I've never tried taking the temperature of garlic as it's cooking


Now, if you're cooking the garlic cloves ahead of time (I roast a couple of bulbs at a time, then squeeze out the cloves into small jar and keep it in the fridge). It'll take 30min to an hour, depending on what temperature you're roasting at (350-400F; I'll throw it in with something else ... not worth heating the oven just for garlic)


If cooking after you've cut it, it'll only take a quick saute as you have more surface area (maybe 1 to 2 min, depending on pan temp) -- but be careful, as overcooking garlic will burn it, which is just nasty. And don't do it in a dry pan, unless you're planning on ruining your dinner. When it's golden, you're done ... don't let it get to brown, as brown is that stage right before black and time to clean the pan before starting again.


Also, it seems counter-intuitive, but finely minced garlic is *more* potent than coarsely chopped garlic, as you're doing more damage to the garlic. It won't help in this particular case, but in many dishes that just want the garlic flavor without being overpowering will use more garlic, but slice it rather than mincing, saute it in olive oil, then remove the garlic pieces, and use the garlic-infused oil for the dish.


...


So, anyway, not not exactly answer the questions ... I'd go with low and slow cooking ... specific temperatures are going to lead to fast cooking garlic, which gets you burnt garlic and ruined dishes.


In dishes where you can, infuse the oil, then remove the garlic. And if you really have to, there's always garlic powder.

2,Why is shrimp rubbery after reheating? How can I prevent this?,"I don't frequently use shrimp in my dishes (once a month at most) because I tend to shop my proteins based off what is the best deal and I'm not usually interested in shrimp unless it is large (at least 15-20 count) and under $7/lb.


Whether I make stir fry, fajitas, pasta, or anything else I can't figure out how to reheat it and have it not be rubbery. Microwave is the worst culprit (even a few seconds in the microwave will ruin the shrimp for me), but even reheating on the stove changes the consistency. When I eat it cold out of the fridge it is fine (other than being cold).


What makes the shrimp rubbery after reheating? How can I reheat it and prevent (or at least reduce this)? FWIW, this happens whether I saute, boil, or bake the shrimp for original preparation.


",<reheating><shrimp>,2019-04-25 13:54:45.577,98678,4,"I agree with @Joe. It sounds like you are heating too much and overcooking the shrimp. Once things like shrimp are overcooked I am not sure that there is a way to make them tender other than to cook for a long time, similar to slow cooking. With squid the rule for cooking is `less than 2 min or more than 20 min` to ensure tenderness. 


I think your best bet is to heat slowly and monitor as much as possible to make sure it is warmed but not heated fast so that it overcooks.


In the microwave I would spread the shrimp in a single layer on a plate and using a low power setting, heat in perhaps 20-30 second increments, testing for warmth after each step. You could play around with time and power settings to see what works best for you. The key is to make sure the shrimp do not get too hot, so make sure you turn them and shuffle positions on the plates.


You could also try heating in an oven, covered with foil at around 80-100 C for about 10 min (this is a guess on time, it will depend on the size of the shrimp).

14,Ingredient selection for Canadian Poutine dish,"Poutine is a simple dish from Québec, Canada. It is traditionally made with French fries, topped with fresh mild white cheddar curds (quite unlike American white cheddar which is quite sharp) and with a tangy and salty brown gravy poured on top of it all. It looks something like this:


![poutine](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UKIdV.jpg)


It's easy to make when you like up in Québec, as the gravy can be purchased in any grocery store. But I live in the USA now, and there is no such thing as poutine gravy here. For the cheese I use Monterey Jack cheese, which is close enough. I've tried to whip up my own gravy multiple times, but it's never been quite right. Here is how I usually go about it:


1. Start with chicken stock.
2. Thicken with flour or starch.
3. Add some pepper, salt (if needed, usually it's pretty salty already).
4. Add something for tang, like a bit of barbecue sauce or ketchup.
5. Maybe throw in a few spices, like garlic or onion powder.


I was just wondering if anyone has ideas to make this more palatable, e.g., other ingredients, or any cooking suggestion.

3,How to get intended taste using baking powder instead of acid + baking soda?,"A [coffee cake recipe](https://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/cranberry-sour-cream-coffee-cake-with-streusel-topping.html) calls for using sour cream and baking soda. I understand that [acid + baking soda](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/83440/baking-soda-as-a-substitute-for-baking-powder) is a leavening agent and you can use them as a substitute for baking powder. But I only have baking powder.


1. If I use baking powder instead, will the taste of the coffee cake be majorly affected? It won't have the sourness of the cream anymore, but how important is that in a coffee cake?
2. Can I add something else along with the baking powder so I can get something close to the intended original taste?


",<baking><cake><baking-soda><baking-powder>,2018-12-10 00:56:10.350,94637,1,"If you use baking powder instead of baking soda in this recipe, you'll have an excess of acid. That's not too bad (an excess of baking soda gives a soapy, bitter flavour). The effect is likely to be as if your sour cream was slightly more sour. If you wish to tone that effect down you could replace a small amount of your sour cream with cream or even milk.


The rise may be slightly affected but this should be minor; with or without the acid in the baking powder you're limited by the alkaline component. Baking powder is usally [double-acting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking_powder) meaning some of the reaction is delayed until it gets hot. Sour cream plus baking soda is likely to start reacting immediately, so substituting the other way would be worse.

2,How to prevent Italian style rice pasta from sticking to the pot?,"Every time I cook Italian style rice pasta the whole pot becomes ""starchy"" and some of the pasta always gets stuck to the pot. Is there a way to prevent this from happening?


",<pasta>,2015-08-02 02:02:40.943,59528,1,"Many of the Italian style gluten-free pastas are made of rice, most of the rest are made of corn or a combination of both. America's Test Kitchen did a taste testing of gluten-free pastas and a brown rice version was the clear winner:


[![1](https://i.stack.imgur.com/lmrDI.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/lmrDI.jpg)


So, my first piece of advice is to choose the pasta carefully, if you don't like a brand try another brand next time. For what it is worth, ATK disliked all of the corn-based pastas.


I looked at a few articles about cooking gluten-free pasta, a few points were repeated in every article. First, start with a big pot of generously salted water. Bring the water to a hard boil before you add the pasta, stir the pasta frequently as it boils, and absolutely do not overcook. You should taste the pasta frequently; it will turn to mush on a dime.


More articles say to not rinse the pasta than call for rinsing the pasta assuming that it is to be served hot. The same goes for regular pasta, you shouldn't rinse pasta except for use cold as in for salads. While I don't have a citation that specifies finishing gluten-free pasta in the sauce, it absolutely makes sense to me to put the not-quite-done pasta in the sauce to finish cooking. Again, taste often, gluten-free pasta overcooks very easily. Reserve some of the cooking water, just like as is recommended for regular pasta, in case you need to loosen the sauce.


Don't be tempted to add oil to the water. It doesn't work to keep regular pasta from sticking, nor does it work for gluten-free pasta.

7,How to make a pesto in a mortar?,"When using an immersion blender, I throw all ingredients into the cup and puree everything smooth. But it looks like the mortar isn't that easy. I can think of four different techniques: 


* throw in everything at once and start mashing
* throw in every ingredient, mash until smooth, take out. Repeat for all ingredients. Combine outside of mortar.
* Mix everything. Throw a small portion into the mortar (to make mashing easier/ensure less ingredients between pestle and mortar at each mash), repeat for all portions.
* Add an ingredient, mash. Add next, mash. Continue until ready.


And of course, there are many combinations possible. 


Which technique is the correct one? And if the fourth, what is the correct order of adding the ingredients? I would like to hear it not only for the common green pesto (basil, parmesan, pine nuts, oil) but also for ingredient types (e.g. nuts, hard cheeses, soft cheeses, soft/cooked vegetables, hard/crisp/fresh vegetables) so it is valid for other types too. 


",<sauce><italian-cuisine>,2012-04-15 15:58:05.387,23045,9,"The fourth option is the correct one. The problem is that if you start with oil in the mortar, the pestle will slip and you will not be able to properly mash the rest.


What you usually do is:


1. Wash the basil in cold water. Put the leaves on a tea towel and leave them to dry (you can delicately pat them with another towel). You don't want extra water in the pesto, so be sure the leaves are dry before starting. Traditional pesto is made with [Genovese basil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genovese_basil).
2. Start with the garlic (traditionally [Aglio di Vessalico](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aglio_di_Vessalico)) and a few grains of rock salt in the mortar. You would generally put 1-2 pips of garlic for ~50g basil leaves, but obviously that is up to your taste (if you were to make Provencal pistou you would probably go for a higher garlic to basil ratio). I generally remove the inner part of the garlic (the *anima*) before mashing it.
3. Now add the basil and mash them with a circular movement. You have to be quite delicate when doing this. You'll see a green liquid forming at the bottom of the mortar.
4. Now add pinenuts and/or the walnuts and finally the cheese. A mix of 36 months-aged Parmigiano Reggiano and pecorino (sardo or romano) is perfect for pesto.
5. Finally add the extra-virgin olive oil slowly, while mixing.
6. Put in clean pots, let it rest for half an hour, then if necessary cover with some extra oil.


Whether you do this in batches or all at once mainly depends on the size of the mortar and how much pesto you are making. If you are making a big amount or have a small mortar repeat the steps for every batch (I would wash the mortar each time, as it will be oily. Remember to dry it throughly before restarting).

2,How can I remove a stuck liquor decanter stopper?,"I had a decanter half full of vodka that has sat in my basement for about a year unused. Now the stopper is stuck on the decanter. How can I get the stopper off to get the sweet sweet vodka out for consumption?


![liquor decaner](https://i.stack.imgur.com/BjMtn.jpg)


",<vodka>,2014-12-06 15:47:54.990,50448,2,"I would recommend not immersing the decanter entirely, but placing it up to the neck in hot water. This will expand the glass of the decanter slightly, but not the stopper. That might be enough to let you coax it out.


The shape of your stopper is also convenient for making a little noose for it out of cord/thin rope, to allow you to get some extra purchase on it, to help you prise it out. So you could hang the decanter and stopper from a beam or similar, and use your weight to pull down on it. On reflection, and in light of Doug's comment, I'm not convinced this is great advice and should be followed only with serious consideration of the effect on you and the decanter, should the stopper rapidly become unstuck!


As Wayfaring Stranger said, a gentle tap around the sides should help, but be VERY careful not to break the glass, or scratch it. Something not too heavy would be best, and plastic or wooden would avoid scratching - or cover a small hammer with a cloth.

5,What temperature to cook a pork tenderloin at?,"What temperature do you normally cook a pork tenderloin at? I was searching on the internet and saw anywhere from 325°F (165°C) to 450°F (230°C) and couldn't seem to find a good answer.


Also, does it depend on how long you want to cook it or in how you prepare it before cooking?

If you need it done faster, a higher oven temp will accomplish this, but may compromise quality. But like I said, for a tenderloin, you don't want too low, or too high. Just watch the internal temperature, that is the key.

4,When should one ice christmas fruit cakes,"It's that time of year again, where Christmas fruit cake have been baked and are being topped up with your favourite dark spirit. My favourite (and most successful) recipe suggested topping up with brandy weekly (without getting the cake too moist).


However, no suggestions were provided as to when is the right time to stop adding your spirits, and therefore to ice the cake.


I usually marzipan and ice the cake a few days before I want to gift it (and/or eat it), but I was wondering if there is an optimal time in this process to do so, and if so, why?


",<baking><cake>,2016-11-03 17:53:17.020,75240,4,"It's not unknown for me to keep a slice until April (well wrapped so it doesn't dry out). All that happens is that the icing gets a bit hard. I use fondant icing, and it takes at least a couple of months to get as hard as royal icing does almost immediately. This is with bought marzipan; if you make your own I don't know how well it would keep. 


From this I'd say there's no such thing as too late except setting time, and too early would have to be over a month in advance. I also allow a day between marzipan and icing. This is mainly as a drier marzipan surface is easier to ice onto than when it's freshly applied.


Some of the early feeds (I use sherry) can be from the top if it's not iced. You take away this possibility by icing early. You probably shouldn't feed it from the top just before covering as it may still be damp. You can still feed from underneath after icing.

6,Stuffed pumpkin on a burner,"I have been asked to make a main for a potluck this Halloween and I thought I would be ""clever"" and bake a lamb stew in a pumpkin. I plan to hollow out the pumpkin and add meat, veg, spices, etc. and then replace the top and poke a small hole in it to let air escape.


The main problem is that my oven isn't working properly and don't want to risk it failing halfway through. Would it be possible to wrap the stuffed pumpkin in tinfoil, and put it over a gas burner on low?

I have taken an iron pan to above 400°C without damaging the seasoning. (I don't know exactly how high it was, my thermometer doesn't go above 400°C). This was on an induction stove set at maximum, I doubt that any other kind of stove can produce such temperatures. 


*Edit* I just heard an example showing that you can take a pan on a resistive stove to above 500°C with prolonged heating, so you should be measuring it if you plan to go that high. (and if you have a thermometer in this range, you can post your findings to further limit the range of 400° to 500°C, because I'm curious). 


But if you say ""no contents"", be careful that it is actually just the pan. You cannot oil it, because the self-ignition temperature (of flash point) of vegetable oil is low, Wikipedia gives it at 327°C. It could just smoke terribly and throw a spark or two when you reach it, but it can also flame up and then you are holding a small brand in your hand.

The left hand mussel doesn't look tasty, but there really is nothing wrong with it. It's just a smaller size mussel. If you buy bigger mussels (e.g. Jumbo), you shouldn't have many of those in it.


As for the colour: a lot of people think this is a matter of sex. Males are white, females are orange. However, this isn't true. The difference in colour is a genetic one, it's the quantity of pigment a specific mussel has. The difference in colour doesn't make a difference in taste or texture.

The first things that come to mind are hot sauce, mustard, ketchup. With respect to vinegar as a preservative, is there a rule of thumb in understanding the following:


* how does vinegar work as a preservative; is it solely by virtue of its acidic content?
* aside from the presence of sugars or artificial preservatives, is there a kind of ratio (or other metric) of foods containing, or whose base is, vinegar to know whether something needs to be refrigerated to keep from spoiling?
* what components can act to counteract vinegar's ability to preserve food?
* upon combination, can vinegar stabilize anything that otherwise would spoil? (If yes, you can answer generally, don't worry about a laundry list)


Note: This is asking not about specific jarring/pickling or other long term preservation methods, but rather to the on-use storage of food items in the kitchen and their ability to keep outside of refrigeration without spoiling.

You mean foods already packaged in vinegar? It would depend on how well they had been cooked/sterilized before packaging and how strong the vinegar is.
Industrially made pickles will be a lot cleaner than something you pickle at home, but store bought pickles are likely to use much cheaper, more dilute vinegar than your grandmother did.

Not necessarily, it has to be something where the vinegar can penetrate into the food - it's not going to preserve steaks as well as vegetables. And of course the vinegar taste is going to help if you are trying to preserve say strawberries!
Also fungal spores can probably survive dormant in vinegar (if not grow) - fungal spores can survive dormant pretty much anything.

12,How best to pan-fry tofu?,"I love fried tofu, but I don't want to have a deep fryer in my home (I'll use it too much!).


I've tried a few different techniques for pan-frying tofu, but it always comes out unsatisfying - too dry, too thin, too wet; I'll admit, I'm not a genius when it comes to tofu, but I'd imagine there is some way to prepare it that will give me decent results consistently.


**Note**: I do have a large wok, but I generally fry my tofu in a frying pan. I've had poor results in my wok.


",<frying><vegetarian><wok><tofu>,2010-07-21 17:06:15.390,2644,15,"For pan frying you probably want to start with a firm tofu. It's a good idea to press the tofu to remove excess water: wrap the tofu in a cloth and place it between two cutting boards, weighting the top cutting board with a heavy book or other similar object. Wait at least twenty minutes (you can prepare the rest of the vegetables/onions for the stir fry at this point. 


Once the tofu has been pressed, cut it into the desired pieces. It's a good idea to fry it at medium-high heat in only oil first, then add sauces (soy sauce, vinegar, whatever) only after the tofu begins to brown slightly. 


Note: the above won't simulate deep-fried tofu. For deep fried tofu, you may want to use a softer tofu, still press it before using, and coat the cubes in corn starch before frying. Of course you probably know you can deep-fry at home with just a large pot of oil. 


For a different texture you can freeze the tofu before frying. 


Although not fried, I would also recommend that you try baked (marinaded) tofu to see if you like that texture/flavor better. You would still want to press the tofu, then slice it rather thinly. You can reapply the marinade during baking for more flavor.

3,How much flavor do you lose when you clarify a stock with an egg raft?,"I have heard conflicting things with stock clarification. One thing I have heard is that your stock will maintain its same depth of flavor but with clarity. Another source says that you have to start with a really high quality stock or your clarified stock will come out tasting like water.


I have noticed that while some clarification methods use just egg whites, others use egg whites, mirepoix, and ground meat. This leads me to think that in addition to clarification, the method is trying to put something back into the stock that is being lost.


My motivation for the question is that I just finished a gallon and a half of stock that came out perfect. While most of the things it will be going into won't need clarification, there are a few dishes that would look nicer with a clarified stock. If it doesn't affect the flavor, my instinct would be to just put in a couple extra hours and clarify the whole batch before storing it.


",<stock>,2018-04-29 08:37:45.120,89480,6,"I'm open to correction, but in my opinion,the main reason for clarifying a stock, assuming gross impurities have been removed, is aesthetic. Not forgetting that the the appearance of food *does* change the impression of flavor. Floating ingredients can be shown off in clear soups - a sufficiently concentrated consommé, made with a large amount of meat per helping, can have knock-your-head-off intensity. In my experience, I have never clarified a stock, by whatever method, without a sort of 'thinning' or 'flattening' of the flavor. Not so much a loss of intensity or aroma (that has more to do with the reduction) as a loss of 'roundness' I think that is probably due to a loss of fat in suspension. 


If I'm clarifying a stock by the egg-white method, I add a mirepoix (celery, carrots, leek are obvious candidates) but I shred or grate the vegetables rather than dicing them. This means that they can create a sort of fibrous mat with the egg-white when it rises, holding it together in quite a strong raft. You can then make a hole in the middle of the raft. At a very low simmer, convection then causes the stock to rise through the hole, spread across the raft, and sink again at its edges. If you're very careful, the raft can be removed in large pieces.


An alternative is Heston Blumenthal's freezing method, which he claims does not reduce flavor at all ( who am I to disagree? ... but I do..). It is very convenient. Chill the stock, remove solidified fat, freeze the stock, and then let it thaw through coffee filter, or tripled muslin. There is less waste, so you could clarify part of your stock that way, without so much of the loss that follows from clarifying small quantities by the egg-white method. 


If it was me, I would clarify only the amount I needed clear stock for, and I'd go for the second method. That way, if you freeze your stock anyway, you can make your mind up whether or not you want it clear closer to the time you use it.

12,"Can cashews go bad? If so, how do you tell?","We have a tub of cashews that seems ""off:"" they smell a little different and taste a little different than we're used to.


They don't smell or taste rancid (to us, I don't think I've ever tried cashews that were old enough to possibly be rancid) but I'm wondering if there can be any other type of degredation in them. e.g. I've read that peanuts can get a sort of mold growing on them that's not good for you.


",<food-safety><nuts>,2012-05-20 16:30:42.303,23874,13,"It is possible for mold to form on cashews - or any other nuts - but only if there has been moisture penetration into the container. If the moisture is at a safe (low) level, then mold won't grow.


See for example, [Mycology and spoilage of retail cashew nuts](http://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajb/article/viewFile/14855/58603), which refers to the maximum acceptable moisture content of 5.8% for retail storage/shipping, although if you look at their data table, it appears that you may still end up with non-trivial amounts of mold in the low 5% range (which is why you are supposed to store nuts sealed and in a cool, dry place).


Honestly, cashews are hard enough such that you would almost certainly see mold on the surface if it were present in harmful quantities. Most likely what you're smelling/tasting is simply oxidation of the fats (the process which causes rancidity) without actual full-blown rancidity. Mold requires moisture but all oxidation requires is light and maybe a little air exposure.


If you really want to be on the safe side - e.g. if your home is particularly hot or humid - then store your nuts in the refrigerator or freezer (sealed, to prevent contamination or off-odours). Although most (all?) nuts are considered shelf-stable, they do keep longer in the fridge or freezer.

7,Why does adding commercial processed cheese to fondue change its consistency?,"I like to experiment with cheese fondues. I've had good results with the traditional Emmentaler and Gruyère mixture, but the best result I've had was when I added some cheese from the supermarket that was labeled as a ""Cheddar Blend"". I'm not entirely sure what that means, but it resulted in a fondue that had a wonderful creamy consistency, which very quickly settled into a nice even coating when lifting out the dipped items. It didn't add a huge amount of flavour on its own, but it helped to carry the stronger flavour cheeses, which I've often had trouble getting into a good consistency on their own (they often either wind up too thin [leading to soggy wine-flavoured bread] or a bit grainy from the flour or cornstarch I try to use to thicken it a bit.)


My question, then, is what is it about this 'Blend' cheese that improved the consistency of the fondue? I imagine it's something they add to make it a blend in the first place.


",<cheese><melting><fondue>,2015-03-31 00:17:56.400,56227,7,"The magic is from Sodium Citrate


Most mass produced cheese it based on ""cheddar blends"". Basically large (50 Kg to 1 Mg) blocks of cheese are made in a milk factory. When a consumer product is to be made from it, the cheddar is shredded, flavour and/or culture is added, and then using heat and pressure it is re-packed into consumer sized packages


In some cases Sodium Citrate is added to improve the hold-together of the cheese


Sodium Citrate is an old additive for ""cooking cheese"", and it can be made at home with baking soda and lemon juice. Gently heat the juice of half a lemon in a microwave safe bowl, then add 1/2 to 1 tsp of baking soda and heat until fully reacted (bubbles cease). Add about a cup of grated cheese (hard or soft) and repeat a gentle heat and stir cycle until it forms a smooth ""sauce""


This will remain liquid while warm


If you let this cool you can mold it, or form ""slices""

3,Making brigadeiros in Portugal similar to the ones in Brazil,"There is a famous Brazilian sweet called [brigadeiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadeiro) (I've seen a few questions related to it around here) that is basically made of condensed milk, cocoa or powdered chocolate, and butter.


I've been making it my whole life using Brazilian ingredients (especially condensed milk) and it has always come out with a shiny caramelized texture, as follows:


[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UDLc7.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UDLc7.jpg)


I have just moved to Portugal and the results from using the local condensed milk are sightly different in texture: it's a lot more grainy (as if it had flour added) and less shiny.


As from the products labels, it seems that the local condensed milk has more proteins per serving. It makes sense, since I thought that those grains could be small curdles of protein. Also, by having a smaller ratio of sugars, it could be that less caramelization (which is important for the texture) occurs.


So, before I start experimenting and wasting food, I would like to know if anyone knows a way to make this work.


My first guess is to increase the ph a bit by mixing some baking soda before heating as it may inhibit the formation of curdles. On the other hand, maybe just adding more sugar could help, but these things already are damn sweet, it seems wrong to put even more sugar into it!


Any insights on this? 


",<chocolate><dessert><brazilian-cuisine>,2017-12-07 14:31:58.417,86801,1,"After much thinking and experimenting, it seems that mixing the ingredients thoroughly very well before cooking does the job. I used a very powerful hand blender I recently bought to speed things up (by a lot).


My theory is that something there was coagulating very quickly with the heat and mixing prevents it from lumping together, forming smaller particles and thus a smoother texture!


obs: By the way, I'm still curious about the science behind it. If anyone knows, please share!

3,Sponge cake - Why mix milk and butter instead of folding?,"From what I understand, after whisking the eggs and sugar you fold in the flour to prevent flattening the air bubbles in the mixture you just incorporated. So why then do some recipes say you should stir or whisk melted butter and milk mix afterwards to the egg-sugar-flour mix? Does this not destroy the air bubbles?


",<cake><sponge-cake>,2016-10-08 14:01:12.840,75367,7,"I can't say why you'd want to do this *in general* for other types of sponge cakes. But *in the linked recipe* it's very clear. The reason is because the milk/butter mixture is heated ""to just under a boil"" and according to the instructions should still be at least ""hot (about 150F)"" when added.


In this case, you take out a small portion of the batter, then add this hot liquid mixture to it. If you don't mix rapidly while doing so and if the temperature is a little off and too hot, you run the risk of coagulating the eggs in the batter (which would obviously *not* result in a desirable texture to add back into the rest of the batter).


Here, as the recipe notes, you're using this portion of the batter as a *liaison*, which is a fancy word for a mixture the serves as an intermediary temperature between something hot and something cooler. By adding the hot milk/butter mixture to a small portion of the batter (rather than the whole batter), you cool it enough so that it won't risk coagulating eggs in the whole batter.


But in the process, you need to whisk rapidly to avoid small egg bits forming curds and becoming solid, so you're sacrificing some of the bubbles in this portion of the batter to create an appropriate intermediary temperature mixture, which then is presumably supposed to be gently folded back into the rest of the batter.




---


Now, the question is why you're heating the milk in the first place. There is a whole genre of cakes called ""hot milk cakes"" or ""hot milk sponge cakes,"" which seem to have originated in the early 20th century. They use this rather unusual mixing method, where you beat the sugar and eggs for a long time first, then add flour and dry ingredients, and then add liquid and fat at the end. 


I'd speculate that the hot milk serves two purposes: (1) it helps melt the butter, which both allows the liquid butter to combine easier with the existing mixture and causes it to coat the flour better which results in a tender crumb (less gluten network formation), and (2) it raises the temperature of the batter above room temperature, thus shortening the time before the cake structure starts to solidify while baking. My guess is that this is helpful because the sugar/egg foam is less stable than, say, a sugar/butter ""creamed"" foam (as in a pound cake), and if you don't get the eggs to coagulate fast enough, the whole thing might collapse. (Again, that last part is just a guess.) The goal is to end up with a very light and tender cake.

9,Why would a baking recipe call for both cake and bread flour?,"I recently encountered a [recipe](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/09/dining/091crex.html) for chocolate chip cookies that mixes both cake and bread flour. Why would a baker want to do this? Cake flour, after all, is typically used for its low gluten content, and bread flour is often used for its high gluten content. Mixing the two would seem to defeat the purpose of using either.


",<baking><cookies><flour>,2013-10-28 03:53:20.527,37951,9,"The author of this recipe probably happens to keep in his pantry (or more professionally speaking, dry store) just those two types of flour, and so has specified a mix to get a mid-level flour with moderate protein levels, tailored to his preferences. Given that the author is Jacques Torres, this is almost certainly a scaled down translation of a professional recipe, where that is not an uncommon practice (the very odd measurements support the idea of scaling and rounding; the weird flour measurements are probably the closest volume equivalent to a weight based scaled recipe).


Two commercial varieties (all purpose, and the less common pastry flour) also have protein levels in between cake flour and bread flour, with pastry flour being somewhere between cake flour and all purpose, typically.


If you happen to have all purpose (and you almost certainly do) I would suggest using it in the recipe for the total of both specialty flours. Very few cookie recipes are so fussy that it will actually matter very much.

A savory pizzelle would also fit - you have to form those when hot, before they harden, and the standard pizzelle maker limits the size, but there might be ways around that limitation.


You can also steam and then bake tacos (which you can either purchase or make) into various shapes by laying them in or over something that shapes them the way you like when baking.


I don't know if there's a way to get pappadums soft enough to shape without cracking before heating and hardening/blistering - though they can be somewhat pliable when hot, they are prone to crack.

2,Expired panko bread crumbs,"A couple of days ago, I used some expired panko bread crumbs (expired by at least 5 months) for chicken tenders.

As the first step of the recipe, I lightly fry the panko bread crumbs in a little oil and that removed that bad oil smell instantly. The chicken tenders smelt and tasted fine as well.

1,Can lemon sodas go bad?,"So, I just opened up a bottle of lemon-flavored soda that had been sitting in my family's garage for a few years, and I noticed that its flavor seemed different than it normally is. I wasn't sure if it was safe to consume or not, so I tipped my glass out into the sink after a couple of sips, and then looked at the bottle and noticed that the color looked a little yellowish, rather than completely transparent like normal. One of my family members tried a small glass of it, noted that it lacked carbonation, and said it probably just tasted strange because it was flat.


The best before date on the bottle was in 2018, and we live in an area where temperatures in the summer can reach 30-40 degrees C, though I'm uncertain exactly how hot the garage gets. It wouldn't have been exposed to direct sunlight, though.


Can bottles of soda go off, either due to chemical changes in the soda, or due to the plastic in the bottle breaking down? It was sealed the entire time, so I don't think that any bacteria or wild yeast would have gotten into it, right?


It’s a regular soda, not diet. Ingredients on its label are “carbonated water, sugar, acidity regulator (330), natural flavour, preservatives (211, 202).”


",<food-safety><food-science><spoilage><soda>,2020-04-15 08:48:26.017,107632,1,"Acidity regulator E330 is [citric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid). I found no indication that it's chemically instable at temperatures < 100°C and a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6955501) found it stable over a period of 5 months.


Additive E211 is [sodium benzoate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_benzoate) that's used to stop bacterial and fungal growth in acidic foods and drinks. A study [found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30021187) that over a period of 90 days 4 - 8% of sodium benzoate degrades. I'm no chemist and don't know what chemicals the result of this degradation are, but they could influence the taste of the soda and loose the ability to stop bacteria growth.


[Another study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-4557.1994.tb00152.x) found that in peach puree treated with sodium benzoate, the amount of sucrose (common sugar) decreased and the amount of glucose and fructose increased. Although all 3 are different types of sugars, there is a notable difference in taste.


Additive E202 is [potassium sorbate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_sorbate), another food preservative and probably the culprit for the yellow color. [Food Reviews International](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/87559129409540986) writes:



> 
> However, in solutions and in foods, [potassium sorbate] undergoes autoxidation during storage, forming carbonyls and other compounds. Many factors (e.g., pH, temperature, packaging, water activity, and composition of food) influence its stability. Degradation of sorbic acid is associated with development of browning in foods. Acetaldehyde and /3‐carboxylacrolein have been reported to be the major degradation products of sorbic acid in aqueous solutions. β‐Carboxylacrolein is found to be responsible for sorbate‐induced browning in foods as it reacts with amino acids and proteins to form brown pigments.

Plastic bottles are known to let the carbonation of carbonated water escape over a long time. Carbonation means that [carbonic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonic_acid) is solved in water, which then forms little bubbles of carbon dioxite (CO2). As long as the carbonic acid is still dissolved in the soda, it adds a slightly tart flavor to it, which we are used to. Once most of it evaporated, the overall flavor of the soda changes to that of a stale soda (which it basicly is).


As to the ""natural flavor"", since it's not named, we cannot know for sure what it was. But there's a good chance that it also degenerated at least partially over time.


So, to answer your question: **Yes, lemon sodas can go bad.** That's why there is a ""best before"" date printed on them. As far as I understand the chemistry involved, your soda wasn't poisenous, but it was chemically altered enough to be considered ""gone bad"".

1,Why didn't my ricotta curdle?,"I've been making my own yogurt for a while – 1-2 quarts of whole milk, 12 hours cooked, into 1-2 pints after straining it all day. A few batches ago I started saving the whey. Today I tried to make ricotta from it: I heated the whey (one big pickle jar, probably about 24oz but I didn't measure, plus the extra whey from today's one-quart batch). Heated it on the stove to 195 F, added vinegar, stirred it, left it for a while, no visible curdling happened. Poured it through a strainer with a lot of layers of cheesecloth on it, the liquid that came through was about as cloudy as it was at the start and there were no curds I could see.


Any idea?


",<cheese-making><dairy><whey>,2020-01-08 02:25:49.980,104616,6,"According to the [US Department of Agriculture's FoodData](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/170885/nutrients), there is 0.76 g of protein in 100 g of acid whey (whey from drained yoghurt; whey from cheese production is ""sweet"").


According to the same source, a quart of acid whey weighs 984 g, so 24 fl oz weighs 738 g, and therefore contains 5.6 g or 0.2 oz of protein total. Even if none of it passed through your cheesecloth, that might not be enough curds to see; in any case, you'll need a *lot* more whey before the process is worthwhile.


Sweet whey is not much better at 0.85 g / 100 g; usually when people talk about making ricotta at home they are actually making some other type of fresh cheese from whole milk rather than whey. Real ricotta is almost always a by-product of making other cheeses in far larger amounts.

1,Is it true that natural peanut butter splits in cookies?,"I was watching a video recipe about peanut butter cookies.

Is this true?


My peanut butter contains these ingredients: peanuts, vegetable oil, vegetable fat, salt. I'm assuming this isn't 100% natural peanut butter? Is it only natural peanut butter if it contains only peanuts?

That lack of emulsifiers could make a huge difference but it depends a lot on the recipe.


In a normal cookie dough fat is creamed with sugar and eggs are beaten in one at a time which adds a ton of emulsification power from the lecithin in the yolks.


Additionally- the fat will bind with the flour and be baked into the cookies. Like Jefromi- I have not had any problem with the fat from natural peanut butter separating out after baking.


If you made a cookie dough and either left out the yolks or didn't beat it well enough to properly emulsify- and then let the batter sit out for a while before baking I would fully expect the peanut oil to separate.

I'd love to be able to buy boneless skin-on thighs as they seem like the ultimate easy/juicy/flavourful cut of chicken.


Is there just such a small demand for boneless skin-on thighs that they don't bother producing them, or is there a butchery processing reason (e.g. does industrial-scale deboning damage the skin)?

2,"What counts as ""anaerobic"" re: botulism?","I've always heard that *C. botulinum* needs an ""anaerobic"" environment to grow. But what exactly counts as that?


Presumably stuff like sous vide bags. Or oil (like in herbs under oil). Seems fairly clear.


But then I read this in a 2011 Harold McGee column (<http://www.curiouscook.com/site/2011/08/bending-the-rules-on-bacteria-new-york-times.html>):



> 
> One such spore-forming bacterium is Clostridium botulinum, which can
>  grow in the oxygen-poor depths of a stockpot, and whose neurotoxin
>  causes botulism.
> 
> 
> 


So what other not-obviously-anaerobic environments can *C. botulinum* live in? The center of a casserole? In the middle of an hunk of solid meat or plant? 


",<food-safety><botulism>,2016-11-26 04:07:21.090,75890,7,"[Anaerobic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic) simply means ""absence of air.""


Any liquid food environment basically counts as ""anaerobic."" Yes, there may be some dissolved gases and exchange of air may happen near the surface of a liquid like water, but deeper in an undisturbed liquid, there's often not enough air to prevent botulism growth. Some basically ""solid"" foods count too, if they aren't porous or are highly viscous (but apparent solids) and contain a high enough moisture content for bacteria to grow and spread. Any solids that are relatively moist and close-packed are also a particular problem (think sausages).


Whether all of these anaerobic environments will grow botulism then depends on various other factors. Botulism bacteria need food. They dislike acidity or excess salt (think pickles) or excess sugar (think preserves) or alcohol (think fermentation), which are all traditional preservation methods. They need a certain level of water -- hence why drying was also a traditional preservation method and why solid hunks of stuff are less likely to cause problems (unless they have sufficient internal moisture). Also, oil-rich environments lack water and may not grow botulism (think mayonnaise) but water-containing food within oil can (think garlic or herbs in oil).


All of these may be ""anaerobic"" environments, but the other factors can prevent botulism.


Lastly, you have things like temperature -- chilling will slow botulism growth to a crawl and at low temperatures stop it completely. That's the last traditional preservation method: chilling or freezing.


Basically, anything under liquid left at room temperature *for extended periods* could conceivably grow botulism bacteria, assuming adequate ""food"" (for the bacteria) is present and none of the ""preserving"" environmental conditions mentioned above. Note the ""extended periods"" -- compared to other food poisoning bacteria, botulism grows more slowly and generally needs at least a couple days to grow to appreciable levels. And that's why any type of canning recipes, etc. from official organizations are rigorously tested with exact measurements for preservation agents (like acid, salt, etc.), unless they undergo a ""pressure canning"" step that heats the food hot enough to actually kill botulism spores (which will survive boiling). Similarly, preserved meats (especially processed ground ones) that can remain at room temperature need to be treated with excessive salt for long periods (sometimes acid as well), and often other agents (like nitrates or nitrites) to inhibit botulism growth.


So yes, as Harold McGee mentions, stock left at room temperature for a few days can definitely grow botulism bacteria. A casserole left at room temperature for a few days could likely grow them too. Meat left at room temperature can definitely grow botulism, which is actually one of the biggest problems for actual cases of botulism after canning -- improperly preserved meat not kept under refrigeration. 


""Solid"" meat and vegetables are less likely to have botulism bacteria far in their interior in the first place (and often aren't ""wet"" enough for the bacteria to spread far), but *if* they become contaminated, they can be a problem too. For example: [baked potatoes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9652437) stored in foil and kept at room temperature have been known to be a cause, as have [pickled eggs](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4934a2.htm) that were pricked before pickling (thus inadvertently introducing botulism bacteria into the otherwise sterile yolk).


To quote the [FDA](http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/CausesOfIllnessBadBugBook/ucm070000.htm):

1,Scaling problems with a cake - mousse layer increases more than other layers,"We've come up with a recipe for a cake that has four different layers (a dough base plus fillings) and is then covered in chocolate mousse. We tested that recipe as a small sample and concluded that the ideal proportion was to have 70 grams of base layers for 80 grams of chocolate mousse, creating a tight cylindric 150 gram cake. So far, so good.


We then proceeded to make a bigger version, with a wider mold, which would weight 1.88 kilograms, so we scaled our recipe and found out that 875 grams of base layers for 1kg of chocolate mousse. But the problem is, the mousse layer becomes so large that it collapses.


Fixing this is fairly obvious: use less mousse. Maybe, since the mousse is less dense than all the other layers, increasing its total weight has a much bigger impact in terms of volume. But how can we define our recipe in terms of volume rather than weight, then?


I feel like we're missing something very obvious here, but if the proportions of the recipe are the same as the small, initial version, why do we get such different results? How can we scale the recipe in order to achieve a consistent amount of mousse, regardless of the size we attempt to make (i.e. what kind of math is required to make a 1kg, 2kg and 3kg cake from one single recipe / set of proportions, considering the form factor stays the same -- still round, same height, just different diameter -- if it's even possible to do so)?


",<dessert><recipe-scaling>,2012-01-16 22:11:45.807,20511,2,"`Density = mass / volume`, so if you double the mass of mousse, the volume should also double. The only way you can get more than double volume is if the density *decreases*, which I doubt is happening.


If you're covering the sides and top with mousse, than mass--which is directly related to volume--isn't going to help, you need to think about surface area. For a cylindrical cake frosted on the sides and top, the surface area and volume are



```
SA = pi d^2 / 4 + pi d h
 V = pi h d^2 / 4

```

with `d` the diameter and `h` the height. You could imagine two cakes of the same mass, one thin and very broad with a very big surface area, the other a bit tall and small around with much smaller surface area. So you'll need to take both height and diameter into account when figuring how much more mousse you need.


Edit
----


We *can* simplify a bit. The ratio of new mousse to old mousse in volume or mass should be the same as the ratio of new SA to old SA. Using your edit that the height stays the same:



```
Ratio = SA_new / SA_old = d_new / d_old * (d_new  + 4h) / (d_old + 4h)

```

I'm going to assume that your height is pretty big, and that four times the height is maybe getting close to the bigger diameter. Then we could approximate the ratio above (there is some height `h` such that `4h` is between `d_old` and `d_new` such that)



```
Ratio = d_new^2 / d_old^2

```

So if you're going from an 8-inch diameter to a 12-inch diameter you'd want to make 144 / 64 = 2.25 times the mousse. And, as this is pretty rough, I'd add a little to that to be safe and make 2.5 times the mousse. (And having a little extra mousse doesn't seem like the worst thing in world.) If my guess about the height is wrong, just measure and use the actual formula, you'll get better results! Always make a little more than the you expect to need though, because nothing's worse than having *not quite* enough.

2,Remove Cilantro Stems?,"Is it necessary to first remove the stems from fresh cilantro when chopping it for a recipe? If so, how much of the stem should be removed?


",<herbs><cilantro>,2015-11-02 22:46:13.323,63092,4,"The stems are edible and flavorful, with a crunch that may or may not be desirable in your dish, but the lower portion of them tends to be a little stringy. I always trim off the bottom, but as for the rest of the stem, it depends on what I am making.


For raw dishes where it is chopped quite finely (koshimbir, pico de gallo) or even ground to a paste (chutney), or if there are other crunchy textured ingredients, I will chop and include the stem (the middle to upper part, where there are also leaves branching off, or as much of it seems tender).


If I am cooking it (as a seasoning in a soup or dal) or if it will be wilted and steamed as it is tossed with a hot dish, then it is also fine to include it (chopped).


For other things (raw, where a crunch will be out of place), I only use the very tender parts of the stem with the leaves. Or if the leaves will be more visible as a garnish or accent, I might strip the leaves from the stems more carefully and not use any (or much) stem. 


This is generally how I treat most herbs that don't have a woody stem, at least, if the stem has a nice flavor like the leaves.

8,What defines a bread as 'artisan'?,"'Artisan' is a term thrown around a lot right now in the bread world. What defines something as an 'artisan' bread? Is it a function of the recipe, the technique, or the person? Note, I'm not talking about just store bought bread here - but books like [Artisan Breads Everyday](http://www.amazon.com/Peter-Reinharts-Artisan-Breads-Every). So clearly it can't be just a grocery marketing term. (It could be more generally a marketing term.)


",<bread>,2012-02-21 17:10:40.997,21585,8,"I think everyone agrees that ""artisan"" gets tossed around as a marketing term that is largely empty or vapid, referring as much to the ""old world"" images used on the bag than to the bread itself.


However, I think there is an actual ""artisan"" quality to food, and that it relates to several qualities or ethics of the producer - which you do find in some actual bakeries:


* Develops their own recipes - an artisan baker should be developing recipes that meet their needs. If they don't know enough to do that, then they are just following instructions.
* Tweaks recipes carefully over time to maximize the intended qualities of the bread. An ""artisan"" producer understands the variables that impact the quality of their product and constantly adjust them to keep the bread quality high, despite changing or variable ingredients.
* Follows the ethic of ""Flavor Rules"", and flavor is the first priority. Of course they have to be a business-person as well, but recipe changes and enhancements should primarily be made to improve flavor, not reduce cost, improve packability, etc.
* Has a real passion for what they are doing, and holds themselves to the highest standard. Artists are always the most critical of their own work, and are constantly looking for ways to improve.


A home baker may not be an ""artist"", but when I make ""artisan breads"" at home (and I think this is what Peter R. is referring to), I do so with an intent to make the bread as good as I possibly can, even if this means baking it tomorrow instead of tonight, or ordering special flours online. I contrast this with my ""makin' dinner"" baking, where I obviously want it to be good, but am willing to give up some perfection in order to get it done tonight. Neither method is inherently better, but they are undertaken with a different intent and process.

3,No Butter Sous Vide: What did they mean by this?,"I just watched an experiment on youtube, where they compare 2 steaks, side by side, the first one with added butter during sous vide (as many people do), the second one without butter.


It seems the second steak, without butter, was far better, and I have since read other sources suggesting to sous-vide without butter or oil for best results.


However, what should you do when searing? Should you also avoid butter there, or is butter OK, when searing? What about oil?


What about the advice, often mentioned, that if you put in herbs during sous-vide, you should add some oil in order to get the essential oils out of the herbs?

0,Is there another way to prove dough?,"My dough is not proving because the room temperature is too cold in my house. Is there another method to make my dough rise without over-proving it? 


",<baking><bread><dough>,2016-11-04 11:25:46.360,75252,0,"Assuming you want to prove it fairly quickly (i.e. you can't wait for it to prove at a cool room temperature because of when you want to eat it), you have a few options:


* Find a warm place:


	+ If you have a stored hot water system, the airing cupboard is good. Although if your hot-water tank is badly insulated it may get too hot in there.
	+ On top of the boiler/water heater, with a towel or blanket over the top.
* Make a warm place:


	+ Some ovens have a very low setting suitable for proving dough. Others are well insulated and with the aid of an oven thermometer you can get a suitable temperature to hold for a while. This can cause the surface of the dough to dry out.
	+ Put the dough in a bowl, put that bowl in a sink of hand-hot water. A thermometer would be a good idea as too hot will kill the yeast.


In most cases you should make sure the dough is covered with something suitable for food -- you don't want dust etc. getting in, or the dough drying out.


Temperatures: [27--38°C (80--100°F)](http://www.theartisan.net/dough_fermentation_and_temperature.htm) should be good. I'd err towards the low end of this range to avoid over-drying.

12,Uses for Old bread dough,"I found some old bread dough that I had left, sealed in tupperware, in my fridge. It has a powerful fermented smell, but doesn't appear to be moldy or otherwise bad.

I doubt that sealed in the fridge it was able to pick up any interesting bacteria that would make it a sourdough starter but it would still be a more adventerous flavor than a young dough.


You could try making bread with just this dough but I would be afraid of it being too acidic and strongly flavored. I personally would just use it as a starter for other batches of bread.

9,Is the advantage of wagyu and other fine beef obliterated when formed into minced burger patty?,"The best thing about wagyu and similar cuts is its fine marbling. I've recently seen a 'wagyu-beef-slider' on a menu at an upstanding and well respected establishment. Upon internal reflection of appetizer selection (which I recommend all must do) I came to the startling realization that ground wagyu beef, which is the foundation of this slider, might in fact taste the same as any other pedigree with the same fat concentration. I got french onion soup.


Was I right that with ground beef, there's likely no advantage to using wagyu?


",<beef><ground-beef>,2017-02-17 18:55:15.353,78506,8,"The main thing that wagyu is supposed to get you is dense marbling. That's especially important for cuts low in fat, like the filet and the sirloin. That is, steaks.


The rest of the cow has to go somewhere. The parts that get ground into burgers on conventional cows might as well go into ""Kobe sliders"". There will be some differences from conventionally-raised beef, where the ground meat is usually made by combining fatty cuts with lean cuts to achieve a precise fat ratio. I would expect ground wagyu to have more fat than a conventional burger, and to have the fat incorporated somewhat differently, but it will vary from processor to processor.


So I'd say that the advantage isn't obliterated, exactly. I'd just say that a wagyu burger will be a lot more like a regular burger than a wagyu steak compared to an Angus steak. There's nothing wrong with that, at least as long as they're not trying to charge massively superpremium prices for it. (In my experience they come with a modest upcharge.)

9,How long do you have to cook adzuki beans in a pressure cooker before they're edible?,"I'm not talking about taste, I'm talking about them not being a health hazard. 


I cooked unsoaked adzuki beans for maybe a little less than 20 minutes on the lower pressure setting (don't know the numbers) in my pressure cooker. Then I waited for that cap in the pressure cooker to fall down and put the cooker under cold water, just to be sure, before opening the cooker. 


The thing is, I don't usually cook them longer, but I don't open the pressure cooker for 1-2 hours. This time I opened it earlier, didn't think it would make so much difference because the cap was down.


I tried tasting the beans and I like the taste, it's a bit more sour than usual and the texture is a bit harder. I'm used to soft adzuki beans, but these are more like chickpeas, there is a chewing sound when I chew them. Also, they didn't expand as much as when I usually cook them.


I'd like to eat them but I don't know if they're safe, so what I'm asking is, I guess, how long do you have to cook them before they're safe to eat?


Edit:  

I found out my lower pressure setting was 60 kpa.


",<beans><pressure-cooker>,2014-12-14 16:49:28.083,51648,3,"I found out that my lower pressure cooker setting is 60 kpa, which is around 8.7 psi.
I also found [this](http://missvickie.com/workshop/meet-standard.htm) link, according to which i have to add cca 45% to the cooking time for a 15 psi pressure cooker. 


Now, according to the [ultimate pressure cooker chart](https://fastcooking.ca/pressure_cookers/cooking_times_pressure_cooker.php), you have too cook adzuki beans:  

2-3 minutes soaked (natural release)  

5-9 minutes soaked (quick release)  

14-20 minute unsoaked (quick release) 


I didn't soak my beans and I used something closer to natural than quick release. I didn't let 100% of the pressure to get released, but the cap did fall down and most of the pressure was released naturally, so I'm going to add 50% to the natural release unsoaked time, just to be safe.  

It can be deduced from the times mentioned above that soaking has as much of an effect as quick release, so let's say you need 5-9 for natural relased unsoaked 15 psi cooking time. 


If I put everything together, the result is that I should cook my beans  

5 - 9 + 50% because not completely natural release = 7.5 - 13.5 min + 45% because lower pressure setting = 10.9 - 19.5 minutes. 


Assuming that the time needed to cook the beans in order to make them *safe* to eat is not higher than the minimum recommended cooking time, 11 minutes should be enough. 


I cooked my beans for a little less than 20 minutes, so I think it's fair to say they're safe to eat.

It's almost like the pan which starts out nonstick winds up nonstick AND seasoned.


Is there a way to keep the pans from getting the fats burned on, even in the short time in the broiler, or is there a type of pan that resists the ""seasoning"" that goes on, so it's easier to get them clean?

2,Fruit Oil Extraction,"I'm making an experiment which compares different oils. It seems I can make oil from any fruit/seed
by just pressing it, filtering the liquid outflow, and letting the filtered liquid settle (keeping only
the liquid which settles above the water in the end).


Though not refined, I should be able to thereby make olive oil and sunflower oil for starters.


Then, it seems I should be able to make grape oil or grapefruit oil with the exact same procedure.
But, I can't find nutrition facts about these two oils on the internet, so I'm wondering if no oil
would be produced, or if this is really considered juice (but that doesn't make sense because juice
normally includes water; even ""concentrated juice"" doesn't seem right since it isn't slippery like
normal oil). Anyway, what happens when you use the exact same procedure on sweet fruits like this?
If you truly make oil, what is the saturated fat content for extraction from a grape or a grapefruit?


Ultimately, I want to compare the saturated fat content of many fruit oils, extracted by a universal
method, so a big table here would be the best answer. But, I don't even know if this is possible
since people don't even talk about the oils from normal fruits.

Due to circumstances, we might have to keep it longer than three days this time. Will it be okay to keep it for a week?


",<dough><storage-lifetime><pizza>,2019-09-07 14:27:56.577,101224,1,"""Will it be okay"" could mean a few different things. Are you concerned about safety? Flavor? Other dough characteristics?


In terms of food safety, it's not the best practice to do with dough that lacks preservatives (added or natural, like in sourdough), but a week under refrigeration is pretty unlikely to result in anything really bad happening to dough unless it was already contaminated with bad bacteria or something. If it's very moist and stored in a way that accumulates moisture on the surface, I suppose it's possible to start growing some mold, but even that's pretty unlikely to be significant within a week. If you want to be extra cautious, be sure to cook the dough thoroughly (though generally with pizza you're unlikely to end up with raw dough in the center anyway).


Regarding flavor, here's where growth may cause problems. Excess yeast growth may result in a flavor that's overly yeasty or alcoholic in tone, perhaps a bit ""off."" More likely, you will probably get some lactic acid bacteria growth starting, resulting in a slight ""sourdough"" kind of flavor. However, mature sourdough cultures are meant to be relatively stable, where the lactic acid bacteria will easily outcompete other microorganisms in the dough and sour it enough to prevent other things from growing. Your dough (presumably made with commercial yeast) hasn't stabilized into a cycle like sourdough, so it's also possible that other things will grow during the week, potentially leading to various ""off"" or ""funky"" smells or flavors in the dough. Again, I think the most likely outcome is a ""sourdough"" flavor that will probably be somewhat good, but it's a bit unpredictable when you store dough this long.


Finally, you might be concerned about how the dough will behave. Generally, about three days is the maximum for most typical dough mixes before yeast start to use up their food and other microorganisms might start to interfere with further yeast growth. There's usually a gradual decline starting after day three or so: by seven days, you may get significantly less yeast growth if you take it out of the fridge and expect the dough to proof before baking. (I don't know what your procedure is. With my pizza dough, I typically degas and shape thoroughly after removing from the fridge, then let my dough sit for a few hours at room temperature to grow more bubbles before baking. You may not be able to get much rise out of this dough after so long, so you might consider how you want to handle it.) On the other hand, it really depends on how much yeast was in the original mix and what starts growing over the week. A thorough degassing and redistribution of the yeast could actually reinvigorate the dough and allow it to proof fine even after several days.


If the dough is not tightly sealed or has some areas more exposed to air, they may dry out after so long. This can lead to tough spots in the dough. Perhaps of a greater concern is the effect of acid, alcohol, and other waste products in a dough this old. While unlikely to cause a lot of problems after a week in the fridge, my experience with overproofed doughs at room temperature and overproofed sourdoughs is that eventually you'll start to see breakdown in the gluten structure, which can cause the dough to tear much more easily or not stretch evenly when making pizza. (I once had an overproofed sourdough pizza dough that literally tore apart into about three or four pieces as I was trying to load it into the oven; all the acid made it much more fragile.) Again, this is probably not a huge concern for normal pizza dough with commercial yeast, but be prepared for the dough to behave more erratically when stretching and preparing for bake. Seven days of fermentation will also change various chemical characteristics of the dough (like sugar content, enzyme breakdown of some elements, etc.), so be prepared for the baking to be a little different. In particular, browning may happen at a different rate than you normally expect.


In general, it will probably be fine, though it might have somewhat different flavor notes and will rise less. However, it's a bit unpredictable, which is why most people don't retard dough for more than around three days. If this situation recurs, I'd strongly recommend simply freezing the dough: pizza dough can be frozen for at least a couple months with few concerns about quality. A few hours to defrost and you're likely to have a much more predictable experience.

4,How to know whether the whole unpeeled garlic is still edible or not?,"My whole unpeeled garlic has turned ""very soft"". Its internal texture has changed too. 


What are the indicators of non-edible whole garlic?


",<garlic>,2013-03-10 06:56:20.823,32566,10,"There are three signs you want to look for on garlic that indicate you may not want to use it:


1. Signs of mold, especially black mold. Discard the garlic.
2. Soft to finger pressure. It is rotten. Discard.
3. Sprouted. While it is still safe to eat (if it doesn't have other issues), it may be bitter.


Good garlic should be quite hard when pressed with your fingers, and preferably is not sprouted. Some people even remove the green core of partially or beginning to sprout garlic when they prep.

",<microwave>,2014-07-23 21:05:36.987,45843,17,"The spark was a voltage jumping over a gap somewhere. This may occur again, but so long as the magnetron survives, you should be okay. The problem with sparks is they can leave a carbon trail deep inside which is conductive and may actually make the next spark occur at a slightly lower voltage. If this happens enough, you will eventually (or shortly) damage the unit and make it unusable. 


I actually work as a product safety consultant and I can say, so long as you have an approved product (CSA, UL, ETL, or TUV) this sort of fault was actually tested. You should be a safe enough and not start a fire.

18,Can I cook two types of dried beans simultaneously?,"My bean cooking method is to soak overnight, then cook in a crockpot on low all day. By dinner time the beans are ready. I have only ever done this with a single type of bean at a time. However, I would like to make chili and I have two types of beans (white beans and red kidneys) and am wondering if this method would work if I mix the two types of beans together. Would this be generalizable to other types of beans cooking together, or more than two types of beans at a time?

The beans should obviously have similar cooking times. For example I wouldn't cook chickpeas with other, harder beans because the chickpeas would be mush. Most varieties do have similar cooking times so this isn't often a problem.

13,Why is the first hotcake always the worst?,"Every time I cook hotcakes, the first one is usually the worst one. It seems like it will take forever to cook and for the bubbles to show up at the surface. 


I initially thought it was the pan, that it was not hot enough, but I've even gone to the extreme of measuring the pan temperature, and it's the same temperature for the first cake, than it is for the last one. 


Is there anything chemically/physically different from the first hotcake from the rest? 


",<pancakes>,2014-05-28 13:37:48.597,44487,11,"Absolutely the first hotcake/pancake is the worst.


Typically, the pan has not reached an optimal temperature nor has the oil/butter that you use seeped into the pan to create a better cooking surface for the hotcake. An improperly heated and greased pan will lead to suboptimal pancake. 


To cook the perfect first pancake (or as close to the second as possible), do the following:


1. Heat the pan (375 F / 190 C)
2. Coat the pan with oil (I use safflower - but can use canola)
3. Let the oil get hot
4. Wipe the oil from the pan (wipe the pan dry)
5. Add a few more drops of oil
6. Let the oil get hot again
7. Wipe the oil
8. Apply batter


This process will seal the surface of the pan (which is pocked) and create a truly flat surface for the hotcakes to cook on. 


Additionally, you should let the batter sit (in its bowl) for 6 to 8 minutes so that it has time to mix the wet and dry ingredients more thoroughly. Make sure that your batter is at room temperature - or as close to it. You don't want the pan to lose heat while trying to bring cold batter up to temperature - this will give you a soggy pancake.

3,Is it possible to get vegetarian grana padano cheese?,"My wife is vegetarian and, since meeting her, I've come to realise that all Grana Padano seems to be non-vegetarian. Is this really the case, or are my local supermarkets just not stocking the veggie stuff? Would be a shame for her to miss out on so many things (esp. pesto) just because of this.


Thanks.


",<cheese><vegetarian>,2011-10-06 09:01:23.663,18229,12,"You may be able to find vegetarian Grana Padano *style* cheese, but I don't think you will find the real thing in vegetarian form.


This is because the making of Grana Padano is still a traditional process and true GP cheese is only produced in certain regions of Italy. It in fact has P.D.O. (Protected Designation of Origin) status, which means that only those cheeses produced in certain regions *and using certain methods* can legally be called Grana Padano. I imagine one of those methods is using animal rennet.


I would be surprised that there isn't some form of substitute available in Italy, as they have the highest proportion of vegetarians in Europe at 10%. I get the feeling, however, that they are perhaps less zealous about it than others if it means giving up good cheese.


The only suggestion I have found as an alternative to GP as something to sprinkle on pasta etc is nutritional yeast powder, which apparently has a similar nutty, creamy taste. Not ideal, but if you make the choice to be veggie you have to take the rough with the smooth!


I see from your profile that you live in the UK; we are lucky in that we have a lot of fantastic small local producers, so it may be worth looking up some local dairies or cheesemakers and seeing if they can offer an alternative.

16,When should I use convection when baking?,"I think I understand what convection does, and (some) of the benefits, such as eliminating hot/cold spots, and being more efficient overall. Does this mean that I should always take advantage of it? If not, which circumstances are better for convection, and which are better for regular bake/broil?


",<baking><oven><convection>,2010-09-19 18:44:05.387,7453,5,"We have a convection oven and almost always use it. I can't remember the last time we didn't use convection. Our model automatically decreases the temperature, so if you set it for 300, then it will heat to 275. Not sure if that is a magic 25 degree number, but it seems to work. Almost all recipes cook time wise as they would with a non-convection oven. Our also has a single and multi-rack mode, and it circulates the air differently in that case. We have NEVER had any problems with the food drying out more with the air circulation as they say that is a common negative.


I am sure the effectiveness varies oven to oven, but in our case, we always use it (except for broiling of course).

Alternatively, you could try substituting baking soda and some other souring agent in the same ratio.

11,What to look for when choosing a dutch oven?,"I've never had nor used a dutch oven, but I have a pile of recipes I want to try that require one. Are these all pretty similar? Or are there things I should look for in a good dutch oven? Or will it depend on what I plan to make? (just soups & stews so far)


(might be this should be CW, but I don't have the option here yet)


",<equipment><dutch-oven>,2010-11-16 14:31:56.510,9176,22,"I'd say there are basically two material options. Plain (seasoned) cast iron or enameled cast iron. I prefer enameled, because you don't have to worry about keeping them seasoned--just wash as you would any other pot--and the enamel surface is easy to get clean. But they're also more expensive by a significant margin. A properly maintained plain cast iron one will be awesome too, and do everything enameled will do for less money, so don't rule it out.


What you should consider:


The foremost thing you want to look for is a heavy pot. Heavy bottom AND heavy sides and lid. You want something that holds a lot of heat when you need it to, and heavier often means more even heating and better searing (crucial for braises and pot roasts).


Consider the lid. It should fit well, without gaps or sliding around. Some have loop handles on the side or on the top, some have a knob on the top. All are fine, but keep in mind that a metal lid handle will be more durable with all the oven time your dutch oven will likely see. They say the plastic ones are OK (Le Creuset, a trusted brand, uses them so they can't be that bad) but I'm not 100% convinced. Whatever handle you get, think about how easy it'll be to grasp wearing an oven mitt.


Handles on the pot itself are a potential issue. Some plain cast iron pots will have a bucket-style bail handle, which I don't think is that great for the kitchen, especially the oven. These are really intended for campfires and camp stoves, so I'd avoid them. Sturdy, compact but easy-to-grip handles of any type are good. It'll be heavy, so make sure you feel secure holding on.


Size is another consideration, and it's a tough one because it's so individual. I think between 5.5 and 6.5 quarts is pretty standard and works for most cooks. A dutch oven isn't like a stock pot, where big is always good. You want one big enough to cook the things you want, but you don't want it to be too huge for what you have in there, or you'll give up a lot of cooking liquid to evaporation too fast. This is less crucial for soups and stews (I'd do soup in a regular stock pot), but for a braise it's kind of important. So I would resist going too small, but don't go too far, especially if you're always cooking for two people. Also, bigger = heavier, so don't let your eyes get bigger than your muscles!


Another option is shape, as they generally come in round or oval. Oval sometimes helps people who can't decide how big to go. With roasts being generally oblong, an oval pan can fit a proportionally larger roast without getting really huge. With a round pot, your whole pot needs to be at least as big around as your roast is long. Ovals are a little less common, however, and generally don't come as big as round ones. They're often more expensive too.


Finally, don't compromise too much on size or cost. Any halfway decent dutch oven, properly looked after, will last much longer than you will. Make sure you're getting what you want, because you'll be living with your decision a long time.

1,Boil water first when cooking what foods?,"The directions on some packages of raw food (frozen vegetables, dry beans, dry pasta, rice, and the like) indicate that one should first boil water, then add the food, wait for the mixture to boil again, turn the heat down, and cook the stuff for some length of time. The directions on other packages indicate that one should combine the water with the food first, bring it to a boil (or to the boil if you're British), turn the heat down, and cook the stuff for a length of time. (That is, the latter directions don't include boiling the water first: the water is heated with the food in it.)


What determines which types of food are cooked each way? Or is one set of directions right (for all foods) and the other wrong?


",<boiling><water>,2013-07-05 20:59:00.497,35113,8,"There is no single universal answer to this question, as it depends on the specific food and outcome desired, but there are a couple of common themes that influence whether starting from cold water or boiling water is the preferred method:


* Larger foods that need to cook through may overcook on the outside before the inside is cooked, if started in boiling water. For example, potatoes are usually started in cold water so that they cook through to the center.
* Some foods contain enzymes that will be deactivated at boiling temperatures, but may act more quickly at lower temperatures. Starting in boiling water would be for when it is desirable that the reactions be inhibited; starting in cold water facilitates the reactions continuing.
* Sometimes it is simply for precision to get a repeatable recipe. Boiling water is always the same temperature (at least for a given altitude), so beginning cooking at the boil is reliable and repeatable compared to starting with cold water which may have an unknown temperature curve as it comes up to the boil.

2,Are poppers better than a paper bag for making popcorn in microwave?,"I have been making popcorn in the microwave by putting popping corn in an ordinary brown paper bag, folding it closed, and cooking on full heat for 2 minutes or until popping stops, whichever comes sooner. It works pretty well, although sometimes the popcorn gets burnt or a hole is burned through the bag. My microwave does not have a popcorn setting.


I have seen microwave poppers offered for sale, to good reviews. They are typically made of plastic or silicon and are basically containers with lids. Would these give better results than a paper bag, or should I save my money and stick with bags? I prefer not to use oil or butter when popping.


While I could buy an air popper, I prefer to minimize the number of appliances I have, for space and cleaning.


",<equipment><microwave><popcorn>,2016-12-05 00:32:42.000,76153,4,"I have used some of the poppers which use ""concentration disks"" made by several sources, and will say I have had much better results with them than paper bags. Popping time tends to be fairly consistent with much fewer unpopped kernels than a dry paper bag. It only takes a couple batches to know what the popping time is for your microwave. If time starts to increase or yield goes down with more unpopped or under-popped kernels, time for a new disk or your corn has gone stale. It does cost more than paper sandwich bags, but with not burning batches and less loss and trouble, I personally found it worth it and probably a push on price. And you need to make sure you keep a supply of the disks. Usually it seemed 8-10 batches per disk before they would start to tear and need replaced.


I have not tried the ones which do not use the disks so cannot compare them.

I added about 4 2""x4"" strips of Kombu to bout 5 cups water cold water, and brought it to near-boil over 30 minutes. I tasted and really noticed the umami flavor. But still, it tasted quite watery. I added 2 handfuls of bonito flakes (they reached boil for maybe a second) and removed from heat. Steeped 10 minutes. I could taste more fishyness now. I slowly started adding salt and it really started bringing out the fishyness, too much. I added soy a little at a time.. maybe a tablespoon all told and it was quite 'soy' tasting. not really the golden-rays-of-sunshine broth i had at the restaurant. I added a bit of mirin, maybe a tablespoon. At this point the stock tastes discordant: too fishy, too soy-like, and too salty, too sweet, and too watery.

16,Rolling boil has barely any steam?,"I'm trying to reduce a sauce I've got but I noticed something interesting. 


When I raise the heat so the sauce is at a full rolling boil, there is barely any steam coming out so I presume there is little reduction happening. 


However, when I reduce the heat to a slow gentle boil, there is quite a lot of steam coming off, so there is a lot more reduction happening. 


Why is this the case? 


",<boiling>,2015-03-03 12:41:40.790,55346,29,"Physics to the rescue:


Contrary to popular belief you *cannot see steam*. 


What you *can* see is tiny droplets of water that were steam (= gaseous form of water) before, but have condensed (= returned to liquid state) again on very small particles like dust motes. If the amount of droplets is big enough in a certain volume of air, they become visible. In other words, you have created a small cloud in your kitchen.


Now back to your pot:


* If the pot is simmering, a lot of water will condense over or near the pot, especially if your kitchen is rather cool.
* At a full boil, the steam disperses more, so when the condensation happens, the tiny droplets are spread out wider, making the ""cloud"" harder to see. Also, the air around the pot is likely to be a bit warmer, so that the gaseous H2O will likely condense at a greater distance from the source anyway.


This may lead to the assumption that a boiling pot emits less steam when actually the opposite is the case.


If you want to verify this, look for condensation *away from the heat source*, e.g. your cool kitchen windows. There, the different amounts should be very obvious.

8,Would boiling make escargot safe if they were carrying parasites or bacteria?,"I've read that escargot can be a carrier of parasites (Angiostrongylus cantonensis) or bacteria that can lead to meningitis. I assume there are no visible signs if they are in fact carriers. Will the boiling process make escargot safe to eat if they are? I assume it's just a matter of time and temp but I want to be sure I'm not missing something. 


",<food-safety>,2011-04-24 07:00:21.600,14305,11,"I think you're a bit unclear what meningitis is. It isn't something like smallpox or salmonella, which are caused by a specific pathogen. Meningitis stands for an inflammation of the membranes covering the brain surface, and it can be caused by a number of pathogens. There is bacterial meningitis, viral meningitis, parasitic meningitis, and even meningitis where it isn't possible to find out what caused it. 


As such, it is just wrong to say that a food can be a ""meningitis carrier"". If you want to say that every organism contaminated with a pathogen which can potentially cause meningitis is a ""meningitis carrier"", then everything is a meningitis carrier, including the lips of your significant other. If a significant proportion of contacts with a ""meningitis carrier"" lead to meningitis, humanity would have died out before it discovered fire. So first, you can't react to such news as to a statement like ""escargot can carry salmonella"". Second, if ""meningitis carrier"" was the real wording of your source, this is a red flag for its credibility. 


If the material which you read says that ""escargot is sometimes contaminated with bacterium X, which has been known to cross the blood brain barrier in a big percentage of infected people and cause meningitis"", you should look up the combinations of time and temperature required for a 6-log10 reduction of this bacterium (the USDA publishes such data) and make sure that this temperature has been maintained at the core of the food for at least the time indicated. Just throwing into boiling water and waiting isn't enough, because you don't know when the core of the food reaches the temperature prescribed.


If your source doesn't mention the type of pathogen, you can't assume that boiling will kill it. There are bacteria on Earth which proliferate in hot geysers, and while it is unlikely that they can both live in escargot and cause meningitis, making the assumption that boiling can kill any pathogen is reckless. If the source was credible, you need to hunt more information, until you know which pathogen is meant, then follow the previous paragraph. 


If your source wasn't especially credible, something like a tabloid saying ""A child ate escargot and landed in hospital with meningitis! We will all die with our brains converted to swollen puss if we eat escargot!!!"", then it was some common pathogen which happened to somehow reach a victim's brain in a single case. Disregard the meningitis scare, look up the guidelines for cooking escargot, and stick to them in order to eliminate the common pathogens contained in it.

edit: now you have updated your question, it was possible to do some research. The parasite was the easy one. 


![screenshot of paper](https://i.stack.imgur.com/kYuVL.png)


This paper is used as a basis for the safety guidelines of some government organs, e. g. the public health agency of Canada: [link](http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/res/psds-ftss/acantonensis-eng.php). As it doesn't say how the 2-3 minutes are measured, I'd wait until the core of a snail is at 55°C, and measure at least 3 minutes after that (or more, for added safety). This will make you safe from the parasite infection, which sometimes causes meningitis (and is probably unpleasant even if it doesn't reach the brain). 


As for bacteria, I didn't find any special information about escargot or any kind of land snails. As all the mentions of escargot and meningitis together I found pointed to the parasite as a cause, there probably isn't an escargot specific bacterium which causes meningitis or other unusual illness. So the usual food safety guidelines apply. Sadly, the various food safety organs of different countries don't seem to have published specific guidelines for escargot (maybe the French have, but I don't speak French). You can use the guidelines for seafood, because for food safety purposes, [escargots count as mollusks](http://www.fda.gov/food/foodsafety/product-specificinformation/seafood/seafoodhaccp/ucm111304.htm) Foodsafety.gov is a good place to start for the home cook - even if you don't live in the USA, you can trust them to have chosen good guidelines. [The FDA site](http://www.fda.gov/food/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm077331.htm) also contains good information, it lists 145°F internal temperature for seafood, but, strangely, no time period.

8,What are some good substitions for alcohol in cooking?,"One of my favorite recipes these days is making a good bananas foster dessert. Everyone I know enjoys it, to some extent, so it's a go-to dessert, for me.


One of my concerns, however, is that since the recipe calls for rum and banana liqueur, I can't (or at least I choose not to) serve it to anyone too young. I'm not so concerned with the legal age limit as with serving it to very young children, like a nephew under 10 years old. The idea is to burn off the alcohol, but I assume there is still some that remains in the dish after it is served.


So what I'm wondering is, what are some good alternatives to alcohol in common dishes? I obviously won't get the same ""flambe"" presentation from the bananas foster, but it seems like a small tradeoff when considering I'll be able to serve it to more people. (I wouldn't make the dessert for my sister, if her son couldn't eat it too)


EDIT: Not to take away from any answers, but I did find a website detailing some [common alcohol substitutions](http://homecooking.about.com/library/archive/blalcohol6.htm)


",<substitutions><alcohol>,2011-10-31 16:32:11.753,18699,17,"I can't give you a list with good substitutes for common dishes. First, I doubt that my common dishes are your common dishes. Second, it would be too long. If you want to substitute alcohol in a dish, you have to understand what it does in the specific recipe, and then use your imagination to think of an ingredient which will have a similar effect. 


Alcohol has mostly three effects in a dish. First, it is a liquid, and its bulk must be considered. In recipes where the ratio is important (mainly batters), if you leave out the alcohol, you have to add some other liquid to maintain the original ratio. 


Second, alcohol adds its own taste. A small part of it is the taste of the ethanol itself, but cooks mostly use beverages with a strong taste of their own as a component of the dish. 


Third, alcohol is a solvent. It can get more taste out of your other ingredients than pure water. (Ever wondered why vanilla extract is alcohol based?) This is especially important in recipes which give it a longer time to interact with the other ingredients, such as the slow boiling of a coq au vin. 


Depending on which of these effects are important to you, you have different options to act. 


* Just leave it out. If you aren't baking, you probably aren't that interested in the ratio. And if you expect the result to taste well enough without the alcohol, the simplest solution is to skip it.
* Use a liquid substitute. This is especially important in baking and confectionery, but you can decide to do it in any case. Depending on the original kind of alcohol and taste you are aiming for, you can use pure water, a liquid trying to stay close to the original taste, or a liquid which gives a completely new taste profile to the whole recipe. For example, in a sweet dish like your foster dessert you can use caramel dissolved in apple juice instead of dark rum if you want to mimic the original, or cherry juice to create a cherry-banana dessert. Common liquids to use are sugared water (when the original recipe had a sweet liquor), a fruit or vegetable juice, a herbal infusion, clear stock, or pickle liquid. Don't be afraid to use more than one liquid to get closer to the effect you want. If the recipe already uses some other liquid, you can just use more of it.
* Use a spice or condiment. This is when your main concern is the taste, and you don't care about the missing liquid. Again, you could be trying to mime the original closely (using orange zest instead of Grand Marnier), or just using any strong spice so the dish doesn't become bland. It is up to you. A special case is to use only a taste ""essence"": for some beverages common in baking, you can buy a propylene-glycol based condiment which approximates their aroma. Rum essence is widely available, but I'm quite sure that the whiskey flavored ice cream in the supermarket isn't full of real whiskey.
* Leave the alcohol in the recipe (possibly reduced). Obviously impossible in some circumstances, like a wine sauce, but quite feasible in others. You don't have to drown the dessert in rum and flambe it. If you use 20 ml of rum per 1000 g of other ingredients, a child who eats a normal serving (150 g) will consume somewhat less than 1.2 g of ethanol if no alcohol at all is cooked out - and in practice, if the recipe calls for cooking, maybe half of the alcohol will evaporate, and a very young child will probably not eat the whole serving. I don't think that such miniscule amounts are problematic for children.


Of course, you are free to combine these solutions in any way you see fit, depending on which effect(s) of alcohol you are trying to imitate. For example, if a baking recipe calls for 50 ml of calvados, use 15 ml of calvados, 35 ml of apple juice, and a breath of powdered cinnamon. Or baste a roast with a mix of tomato and carrot juice instead of red wine. The possibilities are endless, you just have to be clear on why you are choosing whatever you are choosing.

1,Pandan extract in small quantities,"I've just returned from a year-long trip abroad, and now have some interesting recipes to try. I was thinking of making Indonesian *kelopon* but I'm having a hard time finding one ingredient.


The ingredient I'm having trouble with is pandan extract. It's an extract of the pandan leaf. While cooking in Indonesia and Malaysia, I was able to get small squeeze bottles of it -- between the sizes of a squeeze bottle of food coloring and a small bottle of vanilla extract, up to maybe 2 or 3 fluid ounces. This is what I'm trying to get my hands on.


Back in the states (I'm in Baltimore for a month), I'm having a difficult time finding this. I've found that McCormick sells a correctly sized bottle that the front claims is pandan extract, but the ingredients label indicates it's primarily propylene glycol, water, and sugar, with some imitation pandan and food coloring. This is the only thing I can find in brick-and-mortar stores.


On the internet (Amazon, really), all the small bottles of extract turn out to be imitation with similar ingredients as the McCormick. They do have real extract: but only in 14.4 ounce cans. Since the ingredients are only water and pandan (and sometimes sugar), it's not shelf stable. It's also more extract than I'd use in 10 years.


So. Is it possible to buy small quantities of real, non-imitation pandan extract (preferably without added sugar but I can live with it, definitely with no propylene glycol) in the US or on the internet to be shipped to the US? Do they even sell such small quantities?


Or, alternatively, is it possible to convert the pandan paste or dried pandan leaves to extract form without overly-specialized equipment?


",<asian-cuisine><ingredient-selection>,2016-12-25 11:13:47.323,76829,2,"From the recipes I've seen, it looks like the pandan [extract](http://dailycookingquest.com/by-cuisine/indonesian/pandan-extract) tends to be made from [fresh leaf and water](http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/11/spice-hunting-pandan-how-to-use-make-extract.html) - essentially it's a [juice](http://goodyfoodies.blogspot.com/2013/09/how-to-make-your-own-pandan-essence.html). This might make it easier to substitute rather than if it had required other ingredients or preparation, use of alcohol or other solvents.


So, it looks like the pandan paste is the nearest substitute - the recipes look like it can be made from [pandan leaf and water](http://www.ehow.com/how_8542066_make-pandan-paste.html), it is just blended and kept - simple straining should make the extract. Of course, [commercial processed paste](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B01AOP8RYQ) may have preservatives and stabilizers and such, but it might be workable anyway... or perhaps you can find a good [product](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00CA4KJO6) with few of the extra additives.


Another alternative is to pick up pandan leaves - [frozen ones](https://www.philamfood.com/frozen-leaves/) are [available](http://www.templeofthai.com/food/fresh/pandanusleaf-1000000274.php), even [online](http://www.exoticgroceries.com.au/product_info.php?products_id=18395), though it might take some looking, extra charges in shipping, or something like that. Fresh might be available somewhere, but it's likely harder to depend on and will perhaps [take more work](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00GYYCA0Y). Frozen will work for most applications - especially since freezing usually helps with extracting juice (extract, recall), will store better, and will perhaps be easier to find.


If you're using the dried leaves, you can soak them, boil, essentially make tea. The flavor is weaker, and you will need more to get the same flavor, but since the dried leaves are just pandan - you should be able to reconstitute the leaves and extract the flavor the same way. Dried pandan is available as a tea, it just takes a bit of looking.


As for the pandan extract, the advice I found was to buy the large cans of good, pure extract, and portion it off (like ice cubes) and freeze. It will store well - at least as well as frozen leaves - and it will have just the pure flavor, so more flavor for the same amount of freezer space.

Now I'm looking at my aluminum half-sheet pans. They're sticky, they're discolored, I only have so much elbow grease to spare. I'm soaking the pans now to apply precious elbow grease in the morning, but I just don't want to. What if I ran the self-cleaning cycle again, this time with the cheap aluminum sheet pans?

10,Cast Aluminum Vs Cast iron Dutch Oven,"I have seen a lot of meat roasting recipes that require using Dutch ovens, most of the cooks doing the presentations have enameled cast iron Dutch ovens.


When I looked into what a Dutch oven is I noticed some internet sites are suggesting that there are cast aluminium Dutch Ovens as well, They are popular in the Caribbean and are sometimes called Dutch Pots.


I have seen the question: [What to look for when choosing a dutch oven?](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/9175/what-to-look-for-when-choosing-a-dutch-oven), with an answer suggesting two material options. Plain (seasoned) cast iron or enameled cast iron. Cast aluminium was not mentioned at all. I would like someone to talk about cast aluminium Dutch pots a little because pots made from that material are much cheaper and easier for me to get. The only reason why I would not bother with cast aluminium is if it does a very poor job with meat roasting and caramelization of sugar.


Here are some of the things I already know or at least think I know:


* The thermal capacity of the cast aluminium compared to that of cast iron will lead to a cast iron pot having superior temperature stability for the same thickness and size.
* Cast aluminium is lighter than cast iron, volume constant hence lighter pot for same size.
* Cast aluminium Dutch pots are durable and cheap and easier to care for
* Cast aluminium will probably react with some food items while enameled cast iron will be safer in this regard
* The melting point of cast aluminium is lower than that of cast iron


Have I left any key issues out?


What are the likely problems with my output if I choose the aluminium pot given the above points where aluminium does not do well and the fact that I need the pot mainly for meat roasting and sugar caramelization stove top?


",<equipment><cookware><dutch-oven>,2010-12-19 14:36:46.870,10304,13,"The biggest practical differences are going to be:


* Nothing sticks to a well-seasoned cast iron pan. Everything sticks to cast aluminum, even the brands that call themselves non-stick. (I know because I've tried a few of them.)
* While it's true the cast iron can crack, rust or chip if not properly cared for, aluminum is reactive and scratches easily, and even if you get one of the newer anodized ones, you lose the benefits of that as soon as the surface starts to chip and peel (which it will). Cast iron will last *much* longer when properly maintained; I've seen some that are *decades* old and heard about some that are more than a *century* old.
* Aluminum has better conductivity and will, in theory, provide more even heat than cast iron. However, every cast aluminum vessel I've ever used has had *major* problems with hot spots. Basically, both are poor choices in this respect, *except* in the oven, where hot spots are essentially a non-issue; if your oven is like mine and the element turns on and off to maintain temperature, you'll get *much* better results with a cast iron dutch oven because it will hold its temperature while the element is off.
* Cast iron also works great with induction cooktops, aluminum doesn't work at all. [Cast] Aluminum really works best on standard metal cooktop stoves, although it's *okay* for glass as well. I say *okay* because most glass cooktops tend to have elements that go on and off, so depending on your particular stove, this *might* lead to uneven heat when using any kind of aluminum.
* Cast iron is heat-resistant. You mention the melting point, but it's more complicated than that; make sure you check the specifications on whatever cast aluminum you're thinking of buying, because a lot of it isn't even oven-safe (and if it is, it's only safe up to 400° F or so). The term ""dutch oven"" can be quite a misnomer for those pieces as they can easily warp or crack at high temperatures. Spun aluminum is obviously much worse but cast aluminum is only marginally better.
* On the plus side, cast aluminum is obviously much lighter than cast iron and requires less care. Enameled cast iron is also easy to care for but is obviously much more expensive than both regular cast iron and cast aluminum.


In your case, it would seem that your two primary requirements (caramelizing sugar and roasting meat) are at odds with each other. For roasting, you want a very steady, even heat. For caramelizing sugar you need precise control, you need to be able to reduce the heat very quickly when you hit the melting point. Cast iron would be absolutely terrible for caramelization, but is a far better choice for roasting.


Personally, I use a regular (non-enameled) seasoned cast iron pot as a dutch oven and just use a small light stainless steel saucepan when I need to do something like caramelize sugar. I'd suggest you do the same, unless you're really low on space and genuinely need one piece of cookware to do it all.


Honestly, the only thing that cast aluminum really has going for it is its price. The ease of maintenance is overshadowed by the fact that the pieces don't tend to last that long, and everything else it's good at is handled equally well or better by stainless steel with an aluminum or copper core. The few pieces of aluminum (or cast aluminum) cookware I still own tend to sit at the bottom shelf at the very back and gather dust, but YMMV.

13,"""Indian Spicy"" vs. ""Thai Spicy""","What ingredient(s) make the spiciness from Indian food distinct from the spiciness of, say, Thai food?

I know spiciness in Thai food comes from Thai bird chilis; what's the corresponding ingredient(s) in Indian food? Most of the recipes I've seen call for ""red pepper"" -- none of the ground red pepper I've used comes anywhere near that sensation -- is there a special kind of red pepper used in Indian cooking? Or something else I'm missing?


",<indian-cuisine><thai-cuisine><spicy-hot>,2012-01-15 20:54:21.183,20463,27,"Well, that depends on the individual Thai dish or Indian dish and how it was cooked, of course. But I understand what you're talking about. However, the difference in heat sensations is not due to the kind of pepper employed. It's all about fat, really.


Frequently Thai dishes are made with fresh peppers, and have a lot of acid and salt in them (from citrus, tamarind, and other flavors) but very little fat (comparatively). Because of this, many Thai dishes have an instant burst of intense hotness which goes away realtively quickly. The paragon of this is probably Thai salads, like larb or green mango salad, which are highly acidic and very very spicy.


On the other hand, most Anglo-Indian food (familiar to Americans and British) is in the form of ""curries"" which use a slow-cooked dairy base (butter, milk, and/or cheese), and are spiced with dried ground or whole chile peppers. As a result, when you first taste them the fat conceals the capsicum from your tongue, gradually revealing it as your saliva breaks it down. Hence the ""slow burn"". (I've tried to find a medical reference for this to link, but have not been able to yet).


Similarly, Thai coconut milk curries can build up heat slowly and that heat sticks with you -- because of the hot peppers cooked in the fat of the coconut milk. 


Incidentally, there isn't *one* kind of chile pepper used by either culture. The Thai have dozens of varieties of hot pepper and Indians have hundreds (as well as a dozen different regional cuisines, a few of which are not spicy at all). In the USA, these tend to get narrowed down to a handful of different pepper varieties (and substitutions like jalapenos) because of limited availability. The spice you call ""red pepper"" could be any of a half-dozen different ground dried peppers of varying hotness.

",<chicken>,2011-12-12 23:20:29.223,19619,4,"The theory is that washing the chicken (or any fowl) removes all of the contaminates from the surface and cavity of the bird (ie salmonella, etc.).

You cook your birds to a certain temperature internally for a reason, that is to kill all of that stuff.


Really, the truth of the matter is that there are far higher risks in washing the bird and spreading all of those juices all over your sink (thus contaminating the sink and possibly some work surfaces).


There is no increase in flavour, there is no practical reason to bother. Professionally, it is not done.


However, having said that, the one time I do rinse and pat dry is when I am applying a rub. It ensures that the chicken is dry and I can effectively rub, instead of the rub turning to a paste.

Any Scout should know how to do this :-)


It works best using food with tough outer skins, or wrapped in a sacrificial coverings, or more modernly using aluminium foil, or a cast iron pot ([dutch oven](http://andrewdwyer.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/pot-roast.jpg))


Some common foods examples:


**Potato and other Tubers**


You lose about 5 mm (including unpeeled skin) to the fire. If you wrap in Aluminium foil the loss is often nil. Wash and soak tuber well before cooking, but do not cut into the skin, even to remove imperfections or 'eyes'. Takes about 30 to 60 minutes to cook depending on coal heat. If not eating immediately, do not leave potatoes in foil wrapping. Unwrap and let surface dry


**Corn**


Do not remove husk. Soak corn before cooking. It takes about 10 to 20 minutes to cook depending on coal heat


**Cabbage**


Wash and soak cabbage. Drain excess water. Do not remove any dead leaves etc. Poke a knife halfway into the core from the top and pour in a little water (and meat fat for extra go). Can take up to 1 hour to fully cook


**Meat**


Large slabs work best. Reduce flesh loss by wrapping in edible leaves. If you don't like the charred bits, you can use Aluminium foil, or better yet a dutch oven. Time depends on mass and done-ness desired


Small goods like sausage (real meat and fat, not sawdust please) will have up to 5 mm of flesh loss, but are still fun to do.


**Fish**


Gut fish, but otherwise leave intact. Fish cooks relatively fast, time depends on mass. Pull sides apart and eat flesh directly off the skin and bone. If using a foil pouch you can add aromatics, raw sugar, and spices to make some amazing meals


**Fruit**


Keep bananas in skin, make a couple of small cuts to let steam escape. Cooks in 10 to 15 minutes


Unpeeled and un-cored apples cook in 15 to 20 minutes (you can eat the core, it's good for you)

I've read that this type of cocoa is strongly acidic. Will I need to make any changes to the quantities of baking powder? Should I just use baking soda instead of the baking powder? Any other suggestions would be welcome.


**Note:**  

I put in the biscotti recipe as an example. My actual question is quite generic as I tend to add cocoa/chocolate to *everything*! must.. resist..


",<baking><baking-powder><baking-soda><cocoa>,2014-07-20 02:55:03.417,45720,7,"According to [David Lebovitz](http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2010/02/cocoa-powder-faq-dutch-process-v/):



>

> 


So, if you're using non-Dutched (natural) cocoa, you can use baking soda for leavening, but you don't have to. As I mentioned in comments the vast majority of recipes for chocolate biscotti in fact call for baking powder. I suspect that part of the reason for that is that many people don't know the difference between Dutched and non-Dutched cocoas, and in some places outside the US, Dutch-processed is the norm. There is no harm in using additional acid (like natural cocoa) with baking powder. The effect of additional acid is not enough that you're likely to even notice it.


Also note that if you use baking soda for leavening, you have to bake right away. Baking soda, like *single-action* baking powder, causes the release of carbon dioxide only when it is first mixed with the liquid (and acid, in the case of soda) in the recipe. It doesn't react to the heat of the oven. So, its leavening action is short lived.


Baking powder is roughly one-third baking soda, so if you do choose to substitute baking soda for baking powder in a recipe that contains plenty of acid, you want to use about a third of the amount of soda as the recipe called for baking powder. 


**EDIT:** I just came across this answer: [How can I identify dutch process cocoa?](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/13973/how-can-i-identify-dutch-process-cocoa/13978#13978) by hobodave. That excellent answer has more information that you might find helpful. Of note as it relates to your question is this paragraph:



> 
> There is a bit of misinformation that floats amongst bakers that the pH of the cocoa can affect the leavening of the baked good. Many recipes will actually sternly suggest using either Dutched or natural cocoa depending. This makes sense since leavening is a sort of balancing act that involves both acids and bases. However, it has been experimentally shown that this does not actually occur, and baked goods made with both Dutched and natural cocoa powder showed no differences in leavening.

So he concurs. While it is fine to substitute baking soda for baking powder when introducing natural cocoa, it is unnecessary. No modification of leavening agent is necessary.

3,How to cleanly slice hard-boiled eggs?,"After some furious [brainstorming](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/16?m=15891368#15891368) in [The Frying Pan](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/16/the-frying-pan), I recently prepared some hors d'oeuvres for a group of friends. These snacks were meant to include a thinly sliced boiled egg element. Unfortunately I found that I did not have a technique that reliably produced egg slices at my desired thickness.


**My Technique**


I boiled the eggs and placed them in an ice bath. I shelled them and placed them, one at a time, on my cutting board (leaving the remaining eggs in the ice bath.) I was hoping the time in the bath--about 15 minutes--would be enough to firm the eggs to aid in slicing.


I drew a sharp, honed blade (6"" chef's knife that I use for pretty much all of my prep) across the egg and essentially tried to freehand it. The results were tasty and they were fine for my friends but I would have really liked them to be more uniform.


I did try wiping my blade between slices and this helped a little, but the biggest problem I was having was the change in consistency between the white and the yolk. The knife would hit the yolk and it would sort of drag or turn. I tried a few different grips and I ended up just kind of clawing it.


**Alternate Ideas**


For next time, I have considered trying to **freeze** the boiled eggs and letting them thaw slightly before slicing. Something in my gut tells me that frozen hard boiled eggs won't be good eats. It seems like the texture would be changed.


I have read about using **dental floss** to make a clean cut... but I don't see how that would help here. Is there some magical dental floss technique that I'm just not envisioning?


Some quick Googling also lead me to the idea of **wetting** my knife or adding **oil** before each cut. I really feel like the problem is the egg itself and it's awkward shape and consistency. But maybe there's something to this advice after all?


**Results**


As you can see below, I ended up with some small guys and some fat guys. They were tasty, but I WANT PERFECTION!

12,Do I need to cook the meat filling before stuffing ravioli?,"I been making ravioli this past week (3 types, butternut squash, various fungi, and spinach for those interested).


Now I'm onto the meat. Its a pork, beef, and veal mixture.


My question is, do I need to cook the mixture before stuffing into the ravioli? If I do cook it, I'm worried the fat in the meat will make it so that everything won't stick together and therefore be harder to stuff.


On the other hand If I don't cook the meat, I'm worried the raviolis will have to cook too long for the filling to be cooked and the pasta will be way overcooked.


Which is the proper way?

11,Best practices for baking experiment 'design'?,"Is there a generally accepted best way to experiment with recipes?


When starting with a recipe that is not 'quite right', if you wanted to tweak the quantities of various ingredients (and taste the results), what would be the most efficient or 'correct' way to go about this? I am asking in the context of baking where it is hard to know how something will turn out until it is finished.


Is it best to do one batch at a time, taking notes of how the result turned out and then tweaking next time around, but having to go through many batches before figuring out the best recipe? Or, is it generally better to make several mini-batches at once, and taste them side by side?


Is there an accepted standard for how to implement this experimentation process?


Thanks.


",<baking>,2016-06-27 17:14:38.403,70988,12,"It is no different from other prototyping processes or exploratory research. You are not confirming a scientific hypothesis here, you are actively searching. So the most important thing is: *fail fast*. 


So, for the question of mini batches vs. large batches, you certainly need mini batches. And in cooking it is more important than in other fields, as humans have a very poor ability to remember or record sensory qualities. In tasting two muffins side by side, you will notice differences which would not be obvious from notes from previous batches. 


Another thing which people find hard to remember: beat the Not Invented Here syndrome! There is a lot of information out there about which ingredient does what, which ratios are good for a given type of baked good, etc. It is boring to research them if you could be baking instead - but in the end, experimenting alone in your kitchen without theoretical background will never give you results as good as those created by teams of specialists who have been doing this their whole life, and using other information sources beyond primary experimentation. 


So, as with any good research, formulate your question first, and be specific. Then search for answers to this question. Only after you have found the theory, experiment how it applies to your recipe. Randomly changing things and hoping that you will hit gold is what many people do, but it is the opposite of a best practice.

1,Can I use German flour Type 405 for a recipe that needs self-rising flour?,"I'm totally new to baking/using flour in general. I'm wondering if Type 405 is enough for a recipe that specifies ""self-rising flour"".



> 
> Germany's Flour Type 405 is equivalent to pastry flour. Pastry flour is made from soft wheat and has a gluten content of 8-10%. It is soft and ivory in color. Because of its low gluten content, it is best used for baked goods that should have a soft consistency yet still needs some structure, such as muffins, buscuits, pie crust, tart dough, cookies, some sweet yeast doughs, etc.
> 
> 
> Pastry flour is available in the U.S. in health food stores, specialty stores, and mail-order businesses. To make a flour with the same gluten content as pastry flour, combine 1 1/3 cups (185g) all-purpose flour and 2/3 cup (90g) cake flour (which is available in most markets and has a gluten content of 6-8%).

",<flour><deep-frying>,2020-05-09 13:30:00.143,108234,2,"The keyword here is “self-rising” - which describes a mix of flour and baking powder.


So if you are going to use 405 instead, which would probably be a good—enough choice (especially as it’s “the standard flour” in German supermarkets), you have to add baking powder. As a rule of thumb, use one pouch (assuming you are in Germany, where that’s the standard unit) per 500g of flour. If your recipe calls for self-raising plus baking powder or baking soda, use the extra amount as well.


I *personally* prefer he German 550 flour as my go-to type, which is closer to what other countries call “all-purpose”, but it may or may not be available at your store. Unless you are making bread and similar goods, 405 will most likely be ok.

12,Safe pH range (acid vs base) for food,"One of my molecular cookbooks goes into the use of acidity / alkalinity in cooking. What it doesn't describe is what safe pH values are that you can still serve food at.


Note: I am not looking for danger or 'cooking at the edge'. I'm a chemical engineer by training and won't be likely to mess this up, and yes, I'd have access to litmus paper or similar tools.


If the 'safe' range is broader than a (commonly) accepted range where food still tastes good, that'd obviously be good to know as well.

Lemon juice is around 2, and baking soda around 9. Our digestive juices are around a 1, so it's probably safe to go a bit less than 2, but you wouldn't enjoy it. Baking soda is 9, and milk of magnesia is 10...both of which are safe to consume in small quantities, but I wouldn't want to serve a dish in that range.


So...I'd probably stick with 2-9 as an acceptable safe range. As far as taste goes, we're not really wired to enjoy the taste of alkaline. Between 2 and 7 (acid to neutral) is the tasty range.

Will the smokey flavor play well with a marinade? Should I marinade the meat first and put it in the smoking grill (not an actual smoker) or should I rather smoke it first a bit and baste it in the middle of cooking?


For me it makes sense to marinade at the beginning to preserve the juices, but I am wondering if the marinade will prevent the smoke from penetrating the meat or if the smoke marinade combination will be weird?


I am also considering putting a dish with water in the grill to create some steam for moisture and only apply the marinade at the end, but am wondering if a steam and smoke combination would work?

5,Camping stove to supplement an electric hob,"I've got basic electric hobs in my kitchen which do a fine job - but a lot of cookbooks suggest that certain things would be best done on an open flame/gas hob (i.e. anything involving a wok).


My flat isn't piped up for gas and I can't afford the expense of replacing my hob with a better one than it currently has anyway - so I was wondering - would a decent gas camping stove/hob be a suitable and sensible supplement to my electric hobs? 


If so, what sort of thing should I look out for on buying one?


",<equipment><wok><gas><electric-stoves>,2010-12-29 22:39:08.840,10592,7,"**Camping stoves are generally not safe for indoor use.** They can produce fumes or carbon monoxide that would be fine outdoors, but dangerous indoors. Check the warning labels before buying anything to use inside.


As for the actual cooking, I don't think that you'll get the results that you expect. 


My experience includes an [MSR Whisperlite International](http://cascadedesigns.com/msr/stoves/expedition-stoves/whisperlite-internationale/product) backpacking stove (white gas), and Coleman two-burner stoves in both [white gas](http://www.coleman.com/coleman/ColemanCom/subcategory.asp?CategoryID=2020) and [propane](http://www.coleman.com/coleman/colemancom/detail.asp?product_id=2000004126&categoryid=2010&brand=) variants. Anecdotally, the backpacking stove has limited control, while the two-burner stoves don't quite have the oomph of a real gas stove.


The Coleman links that I provided indicate that the white gas stove has burners that put out 7,500 and 6,500 BTU, while the propane stove puts out 10,000 btu on both burners. Using the [REI-provided](http://www.rei.com/product/709000) time for boiling water, I calculated that the backpacking stove puts out about 4,500 BTU (and other backpacking stoves indicate similar times, regardless of fuel).


By comparison, my consumer-grade natural gas-powered kitchen stove has two burners that put out 15,500 BTU, one that puts out 9,500, and one (the simmer burner) that puts out 5,000. Viking offers normal burners up to 18,000 BTU, and a wok burner of 27,000.


However, white gas stoves aren't okay indoors. They're fine while they're burning, but lighting them is a bit dramatic, and once you shut them off they'll put out half-burned fumes for several minutes.


Similarly, propane camping stoves usually put off too much carbon monoxide to be safe indoors.

",<frying><kitchen-safety><cooking-safety>,2016-05-15 09:03:47.120,69020,4,"In a hot pan, the oil droplets jump off for three reasons usually:


1. When you add oil to a hot pan that is not completely dry yet (i.e some water present in the pan). This residue water will boil, turn into steam and splatter oil.
2. When you are adding *wet* food to the hot oil. The water turns into steam and splatters oil. Solution: Making sure the food is fairly dry before putting in oil. E.g. drying vegetables with a paper towel.
3. When you are turning food. Solution: as @Wayfaring Stranger said, flip to food towards the opposite end, not towards you.


Another thing might be that you are using a very shallow walled-pan, but mostly, splattering oil is due to water being present.

9,What are good techniques to prepare liver?,"I don't like liver, but now I have to start eating pork liver because of its high iron content. 


There are some ingredients which I have disliked for years, then suddenly started liking when I discovered how tasty they can be when prepared properly. An example is an aubergine: throw it into a stew as it is, or deep fry it so it soaks up three times its way in oil, and I don't want to see it. Blanch it to reduce the bitterness, dry it before it touches fat, combine it with rosemary, and it becomes one of the best veggies ever. 


I was wondering whether there is some cooking technique which transforms liver into a lovely treat. My biggest issues with liver are 



- the texture, which is too crumbly, almost sandy, and a bit dry 
 - the intensity of its earthy, fatty, almost rancid flavor.



At least, it tastes that way when my mother or grandmother prepare it, I have never eaten it in a restaurant. 


Do you know a way to mitigate these problems? Advice on good combinations, be it side dishes or herbs/spices, is also appreciated. Also, what is the optimal pH range? I'd tend to use some acidic components because of the fatty flavor (e.g. make a sauce by deglazing the pan with lemon juice), but is this really a good combination, and how does it affect the texture if the acid is added while preparing?


",<pork><liver>,2011-03-07 18:49:59.243,12906,9,"Liver (like any offal) needs to be as fresh as possible. Liver naturally has a dense texture, so over-cooking it results in the dry shoe leather effect that causes most people to hate it. 


Soaking it in milk is a common technique, but I grew up with venison liver cooked quickly in a pan with spice mixes (usually a slightly spicy ""cajun"" or lemon-pepper).


I would suggest looking up some more modern recipes to see if you can find one that appeals to your tastes. Chefs like Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, who are keen on re-introducing people to these less popular cuts, tend to have recipes that will appeal to a modern palate.

If matzo meal is sufficiently finely-ground (so as to match the grain of actual flour, rather than the breadcrumb consistency you get by putting matzo into a food processor), could it be substituted for flour in a bread recipe?

But if you're simply curious to know if it's possible using, the answer is no. Matzo is cooked so the heat-treated gluten in it wouldn't be able to stretch and maintain the structure needed in bread. If you tried, you'd have bubbly dough that tries to rise due to carbon dioxide given off by yeast but unable to maintain structure. You wouldn't even be able to shape it without it falling apart unless very wet. Baking would likely make the entire thing collapse.

How close to a machine seal is this, and is it worth worrying about both for storage and sous-vide?


Can salts be dissolved in the water or some other process to both increase the pressure of sealing and maintain a vat of water for longer without nasties growing in it?


With a ziplock under water, I feel goods without concavities seal perfectly and definitely don't crush the food. Plus of course liquids easily seal. Sealing soup bones however will have the plastic somewhat conform to the concave contours, but bridges are seen. Does the plastic somewhat stretch or bunch perfectly to the inner contours with a pro sealer?


",<sous-vide><storage>,2012-05-04 06:16:17.927,23586,5,"For storage, the biggest issue is whether you have a high-quality thick plastic bag that will prevent oxygen incursion. Have a few small bubbles inside isn't a big deal, whether you use the water method or a vacuum. But cheaper/thinner bags will allow oxygen in over time, and your bag will start to separate from the food, and you'll start to see ice crystals.


For sous-vide, I'm not an expert, but I think the biggest issue is that air insulates the food and prevents it from attaining temperature quickly and evenly. I think people who do home low-temp cooking recommending having a sauce or fat in the bag along with your protein to reduce the issues with bubbles. I do know that professional chefs will use the ziploc-in-water technique at home, with good results.


I don't think adding anything to water will affect the density/pressure enough to matter.

But if you place a bundle on the pan, there will be large spots not in direct contact with cooling fluid (food) and so the teflon will get destroyed by the heat. 


Wrapped cooking techniques are not usually meant for pans. They are much more typical in ovens (or in fire/embers, in more traditional settings). Sometimes wrapping is also done in steaming. But doing it in a pan is highly unusual. So consider looking up typical recipes and following them. 


If you really need to do wrapping on a stovetop, use a pan material which can take the extreme heat, this would be cast iron (seasoned, not enameled) or uncoated stainless steel.

10,How do I keep the paddle of a bread machine from damaging the bread upon removal?,"I love my bread machine. However when the bread is done baking, removing it from the machine breaks the bread where the paddle is. I know the paddle is embedded in the bread and it will break the bread a little. I am looking for ideas on how to prevent it or at least make it smaller.


Should I:


* Remove the paddle before the second rising/the baking?
* Oil the paddle before I add the ingredients? (tried it, does not work very well)
* Do something else?


",<equipment><bread>,2012-02-26 15:03:28.513,21752,11,"I used to remove the paddle before the second rising to avoid breaking the bread. Did not find any other good way of doing it.

7,Why add yogurt to curries spoon by spoon instead of all at once?,"A few recipes I have might use 5 or 6 tablespoons of yogurt but want it fully mixed spoon by spoon and cooked for 30s before adding the next spoon.


Can't I just dump the lot in and mix well? 


Edit: The recipes tend to share the same order: cook spices, add onion & garlic, add browned meat, mix in yogurt, add water, simmer for an hour or more. So it's quite a dry mix when the yogurt is added.


",<curry><yogurt>,2011-12-13 23:01:33.433,19639,18,"Yogurt curdles at high temperatures. If you curdle a big lump of yogurt, breaking it up well is hard, and it doesn't taste too well. You want to end up with tiny particles evenly dispersed in the dish. So when you add it a spoon at a time, you can mix it really well before it has had time to curdle. 


An alternative method is to do it the other way round. You remove a spoonfull of the curry and dump it into the yogurt, then stir immediately. When it is completely absorbed, you add the next spoon. You continue until you have something like a 1:1 mix in the bowl, then dump it into the still cooking curry and stir. 


The second method requires less than 30 s between spoons, but isn't necessarily less work. (You may have to prepare a separate bowl for the yogurt). However, it produces even smoother results. If you have a problematic yogurt (low fat content, high clumping tendency), use the second method. 


*Edit* HenrikSöderlund's comment makes me think that my explanation wasn't clear enough, so here an addition. 


The yogurt will curdle a few seconds after it is dumped in the pot. The point is, you don't lumps of curdled yogurt. A lump of curdled yogurt is grainy and sour and doesn't mix well with liquid. Encountering a lump of curdled yogurt in your soup/curry unpleasant in a way similar to encountering a lump of undissolved baking powder in your cake. 


On the other hand, A tiny droplet of curdled yogurt is too small to feel as grainy, too small an amount of acid to give you an unpleasant sensation, and small enough to form a suspension with the ""broth"". That's why you have to break up the yogurt in droplets before it curdles, and this is only physically possible when you start out with a small amount like a single spoon. 


It is even more important to do that when adding to the dry-ish mixture described in the edit than when adding to a simmering broth. The broth is below 100°C, the curry base can be much hotter, causing the yogurt to curdle quicker. Also, a liquid will dissolve the yogurt easily and disperse it, but with the dry curry base, you have to rely on stirring only to reduce the yogurt to droplets.

14,How does commercial whole grain bread stay fresh for so long?,"Every recipe for whole grain bread I have tried has the end result that the bread turns very hard within an hour of baking.

",<bread>,2010-07-19 02:16:26.147,1966,13,"Industrial breads use 'dough conditioners' that soften the dough and make working with it easier. You can buy such mixes online, [here](http://www.preparedpantry.com/premium-dough-conditioner.aspx) for instance, and I've seen them for sale in

The standard 500 ml whip has an internal volume of 750 ml actually. If you fill it up to the max-line, you’ll have 250 ml left for the gas in the cannister.


[Ideal Gas Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law) states that, pressure changes inversely proportional to the volume of the container.


So... say that you’ve filled up to 250 ml, you’ll extend the volume of the gas twice; thus the pressure will drop twice.


[Henry's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry%27s_law) on the other hand, states that amount of dissolved gas is proportional to its pressure.
So, the amount of NO2 you'll get dissolved will be also halved.


50% less gas should be your lower-limit I would say. You'll probably have less volume also on your whipped cream as well. If that's something ok with you...


But this approach will signifacantly lower your yield too. As the leftovers in the cannister will be constant, not proportional to your starting amount.

6,Donvier Ice Cream Maker - why stirring only every 2 minutes?,"This weekend I picked up a hand-cranked ice cream maker for a very low price. However some of the instructions don't make much sense. For this maker, they say to crank the handcrank 2-3 times every 2-3 minutes, for a total of 20-30 minutes.


However, every ice cream maker I have ever used requires you to constantly crank the handle to help keep ice crystals from forming. Likewise, all of the electric makers will spin a beater arm nonstop through the process. Why is does this ice cream maker say to only stir sporadically? Does stirring more cause an issue with this ice cream maker?


The ice cream maker is the same design as this one, but about 20 years old:

2,Is pasteurized milk safe to drink?,"The word pasteurized is written on the milk packets (like [the ones shown here](http://www.amul.com/products/amul-slim-trim-info.php)). They have a use before date.


Assuming it's been refrigerated the whole time, and it's still before the use before date, is it safe to drink the milk straight away from the packet? Or does it still have to be boiled to kill bacteria and make it safe?


",<milk>,2015-03-19 23:31:59.627,55876,5,"Pasteurized milk is the standard way milk is sold in industrialized countries. How it's packaged can depend on the country but it's perfectly safe to drink provided it's consumed by the ""use by"" date.


[Pasteurization is a heat-treating process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization):



> 
> Pasteurization (American English) or pasteurisation (British English) is a process invented by French scientist Louis Pasteur during the nineteenth century. In 1864 Pasteur discovered that heating beer and wine just enough to kill most of the bacteria that caused spoilage prevented these beverages from turning sour. This was achieved by eliminating pathogenic microbes and lowering microbial numbers to prolong the quality of the beverage. Today the process of pasteurization is used widely in the dairy and food industries for microbial control and preservation of the food we consume.
> 
> 
> Pasteurization is the reason for milk's extended shelf life. High-temperature, short-time (HTST) pasteurized milk typically has a refrigerated shelf life of two to three weeks, whereas ultra-pasteurized milk can last much longer, sometimes two to three months. When ultra-heat treatment (UHT) is combined with sterile handling and container technology (such as aseptic packaging), it can even be stored unrefrigerated for up to 9 months.
>

This means that most of the microbes in the milk are killed and the milk is perfectly safe to drink right out of the carton. In fact, there are many jokes in the US about chastising teenage boys and young men about drinking directly from the carton/jug of milk.


Milk in the US is regularly consumed direct from the gallon jug, see the note under Vitamin D that says ""Pasteurized & Homogenized"":

Milk in Europe is often in [Tetra Pak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetra_Pak) cartons which don't have to be stored in the fridge until opened and generally have a longer shelf life due to the UHT handling (see definition above):

I like spicy food and go through a lot of cayenne (and other) chile pepper preparations, and they can vary a lot in terms of strength even within the same variety. So, I'd start on the light end and add more to taste if it's not spicy enough for you.


My wholly unscientific opinion is that when a recipe calls for black pepper in any significant quantity it's for the flavor as much or more than the spicy heat. If you have any ground cardamom on hand you might could toss a pinch of that in as well to replace some of the resinous flavor that black pepper has and cayenne lacks.

I still have a 1 gallon container from the last milk I purchased which I can use. There's a tiny bit of milk left in there, but it will be finished by today. The only thing I'm worried about is that, even if I wash the container the best I can, it will still have traces of bacteria in there from the old milk. Does this mean, then, that I should treat the expiration date of the combined milk as the same date printed on the old container?

I thought I'd do a small ""trial run"" of it since it's been a while since I used it. Failure. I have a few theories on what may have gone wrong, but I'd love input from impartial cooks.

Throw everything except macaroni and sour cream in crock, cover and cook on low for 1 hour. Stir in mac and sour cream, cover and cook for another hour to an hour and fifteen.


When I stirred in the macaroni, the sauce did look a bit ""gloopy"" but it wasn't really very warm yet, and If I recall correctly, that is how it always looks at this point.

Sometimes I'm happy to live with a little bit of the graininess to get the better flavor.

1,Recipe interpretation,"I've been following a recipe, and two things confuse me. One is the ""what"" for most steps, and the other is a ""why"".


The recipe is [here](https://www.apnews.com/45f394ee7c4540d9ba8347ffdedd24a6).


But look at the steps, which I've abbreviated here to save reading.



> 
> 1. Whisk flours and yeast together. Dissolve honey in water. Using dough hook on low speed, slowly add water mixture to flour mixture and mix until cohesive dough starts to form and no dry flour remains, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl and hook as needed. Cover tightly and let dough rest for 30 minutes.
> 
> 
> 


So what happens if there's no dry flour left, but a cohesive dough hasn't formed, or vice versa? Keep mixing? Stop, because I've gone 3 minutes and the recipe said only two? Give up and throw it away and start over?



> 
> 2. Add salt to dough; mix on low speed for 5 minutes. Increase to medium and knead until dough is smooth and slightly sticky, about 1 minute.
> 
> 
> 


Same deal: what if the dough was smooth and slightly sticky when I started? Do I still mix on medium for a minute? Or do I skip that step?



> 
> 3. Transfer to lightly greased bowl, cover, let rise until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
> 
> 
> 


Same deal: suppose I've waited 2 hours, and it still hasn't doubled. Do I toss it?



> 
> 4. Using greased bowl-scraper (or your fingertips), fold dough over itself by gently lifting and folding edge of dough toward middle. Turn bowl 90 degrees and fold dough again; repeat turning bowl and folding dough 2 more times (total of 4 folds). Cover tightly with plastic and let rise for 30 minutes.
> 
> 
> 


A new question: What is the process above (repeated below) supposed to achieve? And in general, what does allowing multiple rises achieve? And why don't we just punch it down each time -- why the fancy folding for two of the rises?



> 
> 5. Repeat folding, then cover bowl tightly with plastic and let dough rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
> 6. [Form rolls and put them in a cake tin, cover, and...] Let rolls rise until nearly doubled in size and dough springs back minimally when poked gently with your knuckle, about 30 minutes.

Again: what if they double in size, but the dough sticks to my knuckle, or it springs back a lot, or doesn't spring back at all?

",<baking>,2019-01-29 18:21:23.757,96028,3,"In bread baking, you do each step until you recognize that you achieved the correct end result for each step, then stop, wait until the appropriate changes have happened, then continue with the next step. An expert baker would work from a much more abbreviated recipe than the one you posted, and if something doesn't happen as expected, he or she will have an idea how to troubleshoot. 


The recipe you chose seems to be aimed at a beginner baker. It not only explains what the intermediate results should look like (""until cohesive dough starts to form and no dry flour remains""), but gives approximate time amounts, mostly for the eager newb who starts kneading and at some point asks ""is this already silky?"". These are basically signposts to make sure you are still on the right path. 


So, what you should do is to stop when the described stage has been reached, and not by the clock. Only if you are not entirely sure that it has been reached, and you are taking much longer than the clock, you should stop, take a step back, and think whether you might be interpreting the description wrongly, or maybe made a mistake somewhere along the way, so that there is not a chance of ever attaining the proper end stage. I agree this may be frustrating for a very new baker, if you have no idea why the recipe says 5 minutes, but it still looks entirely wrong after 15 minutes, but at least it gives you enough information when to abort your attempts. It is not feasible to do more within a single recipe - if you want to be an effective troubleshooter, you need both lots of practice and sufficient theroy (which can fill whole books). 


The opposite case you are suggesting - ""what if the dough was smooth and slightly sticky when I started?"" should basically never happen. You are making the step in order to achieve that state. If it were achievable without that step, the step wouldn't be in the recipe in the first place. 


So, all I can suggest is to try to follow the recipe as stated, and if a discrepancy occurs, play it by ear. I won't try getting into each of your questions separately, since some of them are not practically relevant, others need whole questions of their own here, and yet others are not really answerable in such a generic question. For example, if your bread really doubles in size in the last rise, but the dough is totally sticky, the diagnosis of the likeliest problem cause alone will require a detailed description of what happened until that occured, how you treated it, etc, and may still not be diagnosable from afar. And the appropriate reaction will depend on why it happened in the first place. 


Bottom line: these hypotheticals are unnecessary. Just bake, and see if you will run into any of the problems you described. If you do, come ask a specific question on the exact problem. But if the recipe is well balanced, you will likely not encounter any of them in the first place.

Since you cannot get a crock pot my only other suggestion is to simmer your bone broth in the oven. If your pot is oven safe and you trust your oven's ability to keep a steady low temperature, then try it in there.


If you plan on making bone broth more often, a crock pot is a great investment and if you check out your local Goodwill or Salvation Army store you might find an older but still perfectly usable model for an excellent price. It would also allow you to slow cook your broth overnight safely (and uses less electricity to do it).

How can I stop this from happening? I've heard that acids can stop discoloration, but I mostly heard that in the context of oxidation of fruits. I also thought of sauteing the mushrooms separately and combining everything at the end, but I'd like to avoid additional cooking time and dishes used.


Is there anything that I can do to stop this discoloration?


",<mushrooms><sauteing><color>,2014-06-26 05:59:51.343,45149,6,"Based on comments, the likely culprit is moisture cooking out of the mushrooms and into your other ingredients. Mushrooms contain a surprising amount of liquid, and when cooking them you'll see that they shrink down significantly due to moisture loss. If you're adding them to other ingredients, some of the resulting liquid is hanging around in the pan long enough to discolor other, lightly colored items like eggs or tofu.


What I would suggest is sauteeing your mushrooms by themselves for at least a couple minutes, to release their moisture prior to adding everything else. [Here's a good step-by-step guide](http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-cook-mushrooms-on-the-stove-top-63191). Be sure you salt them to draw out moisture, and make sure that you **don't** crowd the pan (see [this question](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/7343/what-does-crowding-mushrooms-mean?rq=1)) so that the moisture can cook off effectively. Both eggs and tofu should cook fairly quickly, so you can add them after the first couple minutes and the mushrooms can continue to brown and cook afterwards. If you have other ingredients that need to cook for an extended amount of time, you may want to cook your mushrooms separately if the color bothers you. If you're using a separate pan, this won't really add additional time, but you will have extra cleaning to do.


Mushrooms are funky that way - common sense might indicate that they be cooked like vegetables, but there's a reason why [Alton Brown suggests treating them like meat](http://www.goodeatsfanpage.com/Season2/Mushroom/MushroomTranscript.htm) instead.

16,Why peel tomatoes?,"Everyone seems to think it is necessary to peel tomatoes before canning or freezing them. Since I do not peel tomatoes when I'm cooking with them (soups, salsa, etc.), I'm wondering if I can freeze them without peeling them. Does freezing/canning do something to the texture of the tomato that makes the peel a problem? 


",<freezing><food-preservation><tomatoes><canning><peeling>,2010-09-22 11:10:36.797,7521,13,"When tomatoes are cooked (which I assume you plan on doing for canning or after freezing) the skins become tough and usually detach from the tomato. Since you usually don't mind this, you shouldn't mind it with canned tomatoes either, but many people do - even when pureed the texture is different.


When freezing you can freeze whole and the skin should come off easily when thawed.


One way to get around the texture issue would be to puree the tomatoes and then force them through a food mill, which will help to remove tough bits - do this either before canning or after freezing.

9,How to cook pancakes without spreading that horrible smell of burnt oil?,"I live in a region where pancakes are considered traditional food and it's typical to cook them on some special occasions.


For example, right now someone has decided to throw a party in the office and is baking pancakes on another level of the building. I know this because I feel the smell of burnt oil with a slight addition of normal smell of just-baked pancakes. From my experience just about every time someone tries to cook pancakes there's this horrible smell of burnt oil dominating over the smell of actual pancakes.


I'm sure that's not the normal way of cooking pancakes but I don't know how to resolve this in a positive way.


What are exact steps and key factors to cooking pancakes in such way that there's mostly smell of pancakes, not smell of burnt oil?


",<baking><oil><pancakes>,2011-03-05 10:53:35.760,12803,20,"Very simple: don't burn the oil. 


Different fats start to burn at different temperatures (called ""smoke point""). This can be as low as ~100°C for unrefined vegetable oils. Butter is also low, at around ~150°C, which is below frying temperatures. Refined vegetable oils have very differentn smoke points depending on the plant they were made from, some starting as low as butter, and going up to around ~250°C (safflower oil, rice bran oil). Fats meant for deep frying (palm fat, clarified butter) are also around ~250°C. 


So the two things you have to do is 1.Choose the right fat, and 2. don't let the pan get too hot. 


From a nutritional point of view, deep-frying fats are not so good, so I'd recommend using a vegetable oil with a high smoke point. If you can find refined safflower, it's perfect, but if not, canola is also a good choice. 


About the temperature, the easiest way is to measure it so you will know how hot the pan gets at any given moment. I use an infrared thermometer when frying, and make crepes at 200°C. If you don't have one handy, you could try heating a pan with oil on a middle setting for a long time (20-30 min), look if it smokes. If yes, let it cool down, and start again with a lower setting. If not, increase the setting and wait again. When you have found out the setting where your oil doesn't smoke, you can use it, or you can try one setting above (the first where the pan starts to smoke) because the room-temperature batter cools the oil. It is time-consuming, but you only have to do it one to find out the correct temperature. 


You could use a nonstick pan, but the typical PTFE coated ones lose their nonstick layer at about 250°C, and a pan used for frying quickly heats much more than that. It is safe when used at lower temperatures, but you cannot fry crepes at 150°C. So unless you have a ceramic-coated nonstick pan (but not the type which disintegrates from hot starch in oil!) or you are controlling the temperature of the pan closely with a thermometer, it is better to use a noncoated pan. 


If you want your crepes to taste like butter, don't fry them in butter. Instead, keep a cup with melted butter in a water bath near the pancakes. As soon as one is ready, take it out of the pan and use a glazing brush to brush it lightly with butter on both sides.

This can be minimized by double wrapping and preventing exposure to air. An extra really great way to minimize freezer burn especially given that your dish has sauce, is to cover the food with the sauce and then freeze the whole thing as a giant block. I'd just reheat it in a saucepan.

0,How long to sharpen Japanese knife with whetstone,"I'm a fairly experienced home cook and I'm looking to upgrade to a good quality chef's knife. I'm thinking about getting a Japanese knife (e.g. a Shun Classic) but I've heard they can take a long time to sharpen using whetstones, on the order of 45 minutes to an hour.


So if anyone out there has experience with one of these knives I'd like to know how often and how long you sharpen them. I know there are a lot of factors that determine the answer, so you can make the following assumptions:


* Japanese style knife
* Rockwell hardness in the 60 - 62 range
* I'll probably be used a total of 1 - 2 hours per week
* Mostly cutting fruit, vegetables and soft meat, no bones
* I'll be using whetstones of 1000 grit, 3000 grit, and a leather strop
* I want the knife to be pretty darn sharp
* I don't plan to let it get all that dull. I'd rather have frequent, shorter sessions than fewer long ones


### Update


If you're not comfortable with the above question, how about this one?


Do any home cooks out there own a Japanese knife that they sharpen with whetstones? If so, about how often do you sharpen it and how long does it take to get it pretty sharp?


",<knives><sharpening>,2020-05-03 19:26:30.227,109294,2,"It does take roughly that time (45m) to sharpen a knife with a sequence of whetstones.


However, you should not need to do it often. With a 60+ hardness, just some gentle stropping once a week is enough to maintain a sharp edge for at least 6 months. Stropping takes a few minutes.


You will only need to sharpen after lots of heavy use, or if it has been damaged or poorly looked after (left in the dishwasher, used on glass etc)

5,Does tiramisu firm up in the fridge?,"I am making my first tiramisu, using [this recipe](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Tiramisu-351138) from Gourmet (with high ratings on Epicurious). My mascarpone mixture looks terribly soft to me. 


As per recipe, I foamed 4 yolks with 80 ml sherry (I had no Marsala) and 95 g sugar at 55°C. The yolks were from recently bought M-sized eggs, there were no L-size in the supermarket. The volume increased a lot, but the foam itself was runny. I mixed in the 450 g mascarpone (the egg mass was still warmish), and it seemed to dissolve (I hope I didn't melt it). The result was still foamy and runny. Then I folded in the 240 g whipped cream. The final consistency is similar to egg whites beaten to stiff peaks. It is a foam, and not runny, but very aerated, and I suspect that, if left on a heap (instead of a bowl), it will flow flat over time. It is very unlike the cream layer in tiramisu I've had before. 


Is this normal? Will the cream harden in the fridge? Will the ladyfingers soak up some moisture? (They are coffee-dipped in this recipe). Or should I put in some gelatine to make sure it will keep shape? Or some other thickener? I have xanthan, but don't know how to incorporate it, the mass won't survive a mixer on full speed, and it will clump if not perfectly dispersed. 


",<baking><eggs><italian-cuisine><foam><yolk>,2012-02-25 02:23:59.057,21712,4,"Your recipe doesn't specify 55°C, and I'd be surprised if 5–8 minutes over barely simmering water only gets that hot. Indeed, checking for sources:


* McGee, in On Food and Cooking, says:



> 
> When the temperature reaches 120°F/50°C, high enough to unfold some of the yolk proteins, the mix thickens, traps air more efficiently, and begins to expand. As the proteins continue to unfold and then bond to each other, the foam rises into fluffy mounds. The key to maximally light zabaglione is to stop the heating just when the foam teeters on the cusp between liquid and solid. Further cooking will produce a stiffer, denser, eventually tough sponge as the proteins over-coagulate

so that leads to the conclusion that 55°C wasn't hot enough, as it hadn't yet reached ""the cusp between liquid and solid"".

> 
> Egg yolk can be whipped into stable foam only at higher temperatures (optimum 72°C), the volume increasing about sixfold in the process. Above the critical temperature, the volume falls and the proteins coagulate. The protein coagulation is prevented by reducing the pH value, e.g., by the addition of acetic acid. This effect is used in the production of highly stable sauces

so that'd imply you want 72°C, or maybe higher due to the acid (wine) present. As a side benefit, that'd also pasteurize the eggs.


In summary, I think you should have cooked it hotter.


I doubt it is going to firm much in the fridge, hopefully it is stable enough to not further liquify.

* Macadamia Nuts
* Raw cashews
* Roasted Cashews
* Brazil nuts

Aonori is usually of the genus Monostroma or Enteromorpha. Toasted nori for sushi is usually of the genus Porphyra.


Because of those two details, I don't believe you can get the same results from grinding up nori. However, that's not to say that it can't be done if the taste satisfies you. I sometimes grind nori furikake (which contains small strips of nori) not to simulate aonori, but just to get the nori and sesame to adhere to other ingredients (like popcorn).

Another option is canned or jarred process cheeses in various flavors.


Lastly, and probably what I would use, are different varieties of very young, soft cheeses. They tend to melt well and if young enough, don't need any additional ingredients.


As an example, I make a mac and cheese with a very young Gouda. It is quite literally just the macaroni and cheese. The cheese is to die for creamy. On the rare occasion that I end up with a slightly more mature cheese, a tablespoon or so of cream is all it needs to get to that smooth, creamy point.

",<food-safety><meat><refrigerator><storage><raw>,2013-04-08 21:56:34.110,33341,9,"Ideally, you'd store all meat tightly wrapped and/or in air-tight containers. Further, you'd store the meat on the bottom shelf of the fridge, and the ready-to-eat food above it—just in case the meat leaks juices out, it won't be able to drip onto the ready-to-eat foods. That's perfectly safe, and indeed is what's required in a commercial fridge.


The idea is to avoid any chance of cross-contamination. You don't want juice from the meat dripping or splashing (when you move it, for example) onto anything else.


You also want your pies tightly wrapped, to avoid them drying out or picking up off flavors.


Now, if cross-contamination were to occur, you'd want to use that pie quickly, and when reheating it, you need to make sure to bring its internal temperature—measured with a food thermometer in a few spots—up to 165°F/74°C (just like if you were cooking chicken).

7,How to safely handle raw milk?,"I have a couple of questions how to use fresh milk (not pasteurized) coming directly from cow in village (in traditional way, of course).


1. How long it should be boiled before usage?
2. Is it better to immediately boil it and store in fridge or store it in fridge and boil before usage?
3. How long it is can be safely stored in fridge?


",<food-safety><milk><dairy>,2013-06-07 17:45:09.877,34574,6,"Handling raw milk is risky, and please note this information is not professional advice and is not to be taken as an authoritative response. I will, however, attempt to provide some thoughts on handling raw milk below.


Selling unpasteurized milk is illegal in some countries, and official sources usually discourage the consumption of raw milk instead of offering handling instructions (for good reason). 


* The FDA has [this article](http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/consumers/ucm079516.htm) on dangers of raw milk.
* There are other real dangers such as [Brucellosis or Maltese's Fever](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brucellosis) with which I bouted as an 8-year old. Think of 107F fever.


Also, keep in mind when you boil the raw milk you are going through a similar process as pasteurization in regards to the theory on breaking down the complex proteins and [milk protein allergy](http://www.livestrong.com/article/372074-signs-symptoms-of-milk-protein-intolerance-in-adults/). Probably even more than pasteurization since that occurs at lower temperatures. Those theories, however, aren't proven (yet) as far as I know, but you do burn some of the sugars in milk if you go above 70C.


The actual answers:


* 2: It is better to boil first for sure. Don't store raw milk for lengths of time.
* 3: Theoretically, if you do everything right and vacuum pack the milk, it might last a couple of weeks, but the longer it stays, the more dangerous it can get. Freezing might be a better option (we keep our pasteurized milk a couple of months in the freezer).
* 1: I can't tell you how long to boil it for, though the last time I had fresh milk, it was kept simmering on the burner for about 5 minutes by the folks at the farm. It was also minutes after it was collected (fresher is better).


one of the safest things you can do if you're going to have raw milk, is to know the source and get it from a farm that takes care of the conditions. If you know the farm, the farmer, and the cows conditions are safe, you're more likely to be able to enjoy raw milk in peace.

3,Can you preserve canned kidney beans so that they still have their shape?,"I buy kidney beans in a can, but the amount is always too big. Normally, I throw away the leftover beans, thinking that freezing them will turn them into mush (thinking the water will expand and make the membrane tear).

30,What are some good substitutes for salt for those on low sodium diets?,"I try to keep my sodium intake fairly low to ensure that my blood pressure doesn't get too high.


Salt is such a common part of cooking, and it's especially difficult to cook Asian-style food without a lot of salt due to its reliance on salty sauces such as soy sauce, oyster sauce, etc.


I have tried salt substitutes such as potassium chloride but that can be particularly nasty on the palate, giving the food a chemical taste.


What are some good substitutes for salt in food?


",<substitutions><salt><sodium>,2010-07-10 00:12:57.910,4615,21,"There is no substitute for salt. Sorry. It has effects on the tastebuds and the body that cannot be replicated.


However! They can be *approached* to a degree that most people will find interchangeable. Acids can mimic the flavour-enhancing qualities of salt in a big way. The more acid you have in a dish, the less salt you will need. Beware of going too far, of course, as too much acid is just unpleasant and will need salt to counterbalance.


Heat--as in capsaicin, chili peppers--can produce much the same effect.


Echoing papin's information above; NA and K (sodium and potassium) exist in balance in the body. Too far in one direction and you have a heart attack (too much K), too much in the other and (if memory serves; I could be wrong) you essentially drown (or is it edema? I can't remember). If avoiding sodium is related to a health concern, please speak to your primary healthcare provider before adjusting your diet in this way.

1,How long can blended onions stay relatively fresh?,"I'm trying to get rid of textured vegetable protein taste. I usually blend onions, mix them with pre soaked TVP and bake resulting burgers right away. 


Now I'm thinking of leaving the mix of blended onions and TVP for an hour or so so that TVP is fully infused with onion flavour. 


",<onions><blender>,2017-04-30 15:57:16.383,81315,1,"In the fridge, an hour should not be a problem, but could still end up bitter depending on the kind of onion used. Usually, Marinades, Pestos etc. that use mashed onions and/or garlic taste best if they are made the way the name ""Pesto"" suggests: Cutting stuff very fine, then using a mortar and pestle. 


Most explanations WHY that is the case have to with the fact that blenders tend to disintegrate cell walls with relatively rough cuts of a fast but half-sharp or blunt blade, releasing more enzymes etc. from the cell walls as opposed to from the cell contents. These are plausible, since some of the compounds in different parts of onion cells are known to actively react when the onion is disintegrated.


Also, try adding oil (which you often want in a marinade anyway. No unrefined olive oil in a blender, though - that is known to get bitter!) while mortaring or blending - this will help extract flavor compounds and probably provide some oxidation protection.

5,How can I add salt and get it to permeate throughout chocolate?,"Based on a previous question I understand it is not possible to make chocolate from home since specialist and expensive equipment is reqiured. As such I bought premade dark chocolate from the shop, melted it(brang water pot to simmer, added anotther pot wih chocolate in to top of first pot). I then added salt in as I wanted to increase the salt content of the chocolate ensuring the salt is distributed well.


When eating the chocolate I noticed that the salt did not distribute throughout the chocolate and the grains didnt even dissolve properly. large salt grains were present in the chocolate.


I then melted some coconut butter in the same way, added salt and noticed the salt grains didnt dissolve either so clearly need to do more to get the salt to dissolve and distribute. I added water to the coconut butter and it the salt did dissolve however it seemed to still be seperate from the coconut fat in the same way oil seperates from water. I then added coco powder. When I ate it although the salt grains did dissolve it still seems not to have distributed/penetrated the chocolate well.


Chocolate bars with a high salt content e.g. twirl, flake have the result i'm looking for i.e salt is distributed well throughout. Anyone know how i can get premade chocolate, add salt and get it to distribute like the aforementioned bars, or cook from scratch getting the salt to distribute properly? I cant just use the aforementioned premade bars because they have many other ingredients which I'm trying to avoid. 


-- UPDATE --
I have just noticed that the chocolate bars I have been comparing to e.g. twirl, flake do not have salt added as an ingredient. However they still have 0.25g of salt per 100g of chocolate. I guess it means its naturally occuring as a result of one of the ingredients or managing to merge that ingredient with the other ingredient hence getting the seemingly well distriuted salt. Does anyone know which ingredient gives it the salt(I'd guess milk). If I wanted to then emulate the recipe would I simply melt chocolate as previously and then add milk, is there some possible way to make the salt distribution like aformentioned store bought chocolates now that I know it definately wasnt as a result of adding/cooking salt? 




",<chocolate><salt>,2017-05-08 16:33:37.853,81506,7,"You can't. Salt is water-soluble, and chocolate is made out of starch suspended in fat, without water. You cannot dissolve the salt in the fat. 


Adding small amounts of a liquid in which the salt is dissolved will also not help, as it will curdle the chocolate. At least it will certainly happen with water. Alcohol can have some chance of working, as it dissolves both polar and nonpolar compounds, but you will need pure (96% medical) ethanol, not an alcoholic drink. I think this is quite impractical even if it works, but you may want to experiment with it. A commenter who has tried it notes that not even alcohol will work.


The closest you could do at home is to make a ganache with either cream (standard) or water, and dissolve the salt in the water phase before making it. The least amount you can have is 20% water (if using cream or another liquid, you have to adjust for its solid content so you end up with 20% water in total). This will give you a creamy ganache, and quite concentrated, but not a chocolate bar. 


The only other thing I can think of is to go the way you already did - retemper chocolate and adding salt while melted - but you will not have it dissolve. What you can change is to grind it into a fine powder first, so you don't feel the grains as much. But it will still be grains suspended in the chocolate, not salt dissolved throughout the chocolate.

6,Should I wash my pre-washed greens?,"This sounds so silly writing it out. I frequently buy [Olivia's organic spring mix](http://www.oliviasorganics.org/spring.html) salad which says it's ""triple washed."" Out of habit, I guess, I wash / spin each serving before I eat it.

It certainly does no harm, but you then have to also dry them for most uses, so it is more work, and kind of redundant: you have paid a premium price to buy the greens already washed. If you are going to wash them yourself, why not buy less expensive produce, and perhaps have more control over what goes into your mix?

Oils are more solid at colder temperatures ([how much depends on the oil, 14°F(-10°C) for Canola Oil](http://www.veganbaking.net/articles/tools/fat-and-oil-melt-point-temperatures)) While the fridge is not going to reach 'freezing' for the oil it does cause the oil to become more dense and thus harder for it to spray and more likely to clog the nozzle.

2,What exact temperature allows me to store frozen products really long?,"For as long as I remember, I was always told (and I was always so sure), that minus 18 degrees Celsius is an optimal temperature for storing frozen products for really, really long.

Some other sources, that I recall, but can't cite right now, said that in minus 18 degrees Celsius most (if not all) products can be kept until at least ""best before"" date.


Some time ago I went to a one of Polish shops around me and I was shocked to find this infobox:


[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zmKm3.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zmKm3.jpg)


It basically says, that in minus 18 degrees Celsius I can store all products up to one month (so not ""many months"" and not ""really long""), with exception of ice cream (which even at this temperature can't be stored for longer than a week+).


And minus 24 degrees Celsius\* I can store most frozen products ""many weeks"". Which leads me to a conclusion that under no home-applicable\* circumstances I'm not allowed to store frozen food for ""many months"" or ""really long"".


What am I missing? Is above presented table correct?


\* not mentioning, that none of fridges / freezers, that I use is able to run at minus 24 degrees Celsius temperature and to be honest -- I have never heard about any home-targeted device, that is able to achieve this temperature.

5,How is one meant to treat fenugreek seeds?,"The last time I used fenugreek seeds, they and mustard seeds were the first into the pan, followed by onions, then other vegetables. I expected them to soften a bit and release their flavor, but they retained a bit of an unpleasant crunch, in the end.


Do I need to grind or crush them first, or can they be used whole if you treat them right?


",<spices>,2015-04-05 21:17:34.857,56454,4,"When cooking with fenugreek personally, I have found that processing them in a grinder is the best way to use them in a dish. If they are not ground fine enough they can remain a bit more textured. Longer cooking time in liquid can help with the breaking down of the texture as well. However, it is best to just start out with grinding them as fine as you can.


In response to the mustard seeds, I leave them whole, or grind them. Depending on how I plan to use them. They can be prepared in dishes both ways. They too break down in liquid much easier than the fenugreek seeds. So the crunchy texture you mentioned, may have been from the fenugreek, not the mustard seeds. Cooking duration can play a role too, just to keep that in mind.

Which of these adjustments will prolong storage life to a significant extent?


* remove garlic
* add honey
* replace lemon with (or add) vinegar
* change acid:oil ratio from 1:2 to 1:1
* instead of shaking mixture (to emulsify oil and acid), just whisk to blend


",<storage-lifetime><refrigerator><salad-dressing>,2018-07-07 01:18:32.937,90854,2,"Some answers:


1. Swapping lemon juice for vinegar will extend storage life, because lemon juice contains volatile compounds that break down in a few days, whereas vinegar is a fermentation product that is shelf-stable for long periods of time. Also, vinegar has a slightly higher acidity, and (all else being equal) higher acidity foods are more bacteria-resistant.
2. Changing the oil:acid ratio would also increase shelf life for the same reason. However, you wouldn't necessarily want to use the resulting dressing, as it would be way too ""sharp"".
3. Increasing the amount of salt in the dressing would also increase its storage life, at the cost of undesireable flavor.
4. I see no reason why mixing method would affect the shelf life of a vinagrette. It will separate during storage regardless.
5. Swapping the raw garlic out for powdered garlic should increase the storage life, because raw garlic (being a below-ground bulb) often carries significant bacterial content.
6. There is no reason to think that adding a small quantity of honey would affect storage life.


However, all of this leaves out the way to ensure the longest shelf life for salad dressing: don't mix the ingredients until you need them. All of the ingredients in your recipe have storage lives of weeks (garlic) to months (oil, dried basil) to years (vinegar). In unmixed form, you can be ready to dress a salad in a matter of minutes for months, especially if you're willing to use powdered garlic. As opposed to all of the methods above, which you'll notice each involve downgrading the flavor of the dressing in some way, which is why supermarket bottled dressings are so bad.

4,Effect of adding wet ingredients to dry when making bread?,"I inadvertently omitted the eggs from my challah recipe, but realized this only after the final step of mixing in and after fully incorporating the flour. Rather than throwing everything away, I attempted to resuscitate the dough by adding the eggs.


The dough took on a very odd texture initially, then I kept mixing and added a few tablespoons of extra flour very gradually. Eventually it resembled the normal dough.


Should my bread turn out alright? What happens when you add extra liquid to a flour rather than adding the flour last?


",<baking><bread><dough><mistakes>,2013-05-10 12:38:25.297,34047,3,"The main issue you will face is the extra mixing allows for additional gluten development. In some breads, this could create a risk of over-kneading, which could make the dough less workable, more prone to tearing, and more difficult to get the proper rise.


Challah is a basic egg enriched bread, so other than the eggs themselves (which are fairly effective at helping prevent over-kneading) you don't have a great deal of protection. The worst case scenario is that your bread will be a little flat and crumbly; the best case is that you are still well within the tolerance window and it will be just fine. 


*Edit: I will leave this for reference, but I was thinking of brioche:* in a very sweet, fatty bread like brioche, this risk is minimized. The fat and sugars in the dough act as barriers preventing the glutin-precursors from interacting as frequently or as easily, making it much, much more difficult to over knead.




---


The main reasons for the traditional order of dough assembly are:


* As you no doubt realize, it is much easier to incorporate the liquids evenly into loose flour, rather than a partially formed dough
* The yeast acts on the ingredients present, so sometimes ingredients which inhibit yeast growth are held back until after a fermentation phase
* You want time for all of the flour to be fully hydrated--normally, in yeast raised doughs, this is hardly an issue.

5,Cassolette Pans - Cooking on the Stovetop and in the Oven,"So, I'm a hobbyist and like to play with new recipes. Recently I've found a few recipes which want me to fry something, then put the pan directly into the oven and roast for a bit. Then maybe move it back to the cooktop a bit. It seems a bit odd, although deglazing seems a fairly common example.


Well, the problem with this is most pans intended for the stove are very thin and perform poorly on the cooktop. Most pans intended for the cooktop have plastic handles or other bits which seem like a poor idea to put in the oven. I can get along passably with a dutch oven (one without legs) but those tend to be round and often an oval pan is good for roasting things. What I've heard I need is a cassolette pan.


Unfortunately, I'm finding the same problem in the stores. Either pans don't have the weight for cooktop cooking, or they have plastic or rubberized handles. Although I have found a **very** expensive line of colored dutch ovens in a couple of stores.


Is there some way to determine if the rubberized bits are oven safe? Other than buying one and voiding the warranty? Any advice which would help determining whether a pan *might* survive?


",<roasting><pan><sauteing>,2010-11-02 22:53:56.940,8792,4,"A few ideas for you:


You can use cast iron. Depending on what you are cooking this works quite well - but beware what you deglaze with, you might take your finish off or impart a taste to your food.


You can read the label on your rubber/plastic handle cookware. Many are oven-safe to 350F or so, the label should tell you.


You can use stainless steel or other all metal cookware. [Paderno](http://www.paderno.com/) is my (Canadian!) favourite. Alternately go to your local restaurant supply store - so-called *professional* gear can actually be quite reasonable, because a kitchen has to buy so much of it.

I am not an espresso fan myself--I like regular coffee, but not after it has cooled down, and never reheated. Many folks are perfectly content to microwave a cold cup and drink it.


I imagine that older, colder espresso is palatable to you to the extent that you are willing to tolerate it. A small shot of coffee--and lets face it, that is all espresso is, even if it is brewed in a fancy manner--is going to cool off much more rapidly than a full cup, or a full pot.

4,Why is orange juice or apple juice added in a smoothie?,"I currently have strawberries, bananas and yogurt in my fridge and this got me thinking about the Strawberry-Banana Julius from Orange Julius. Previously I've made smoothies with strawberries, bananas, yogurt, milk and a light dash of sugar.


I know most places add in some orange juice or apple juice. What does the addition of orange juice or apple juice do to the smoothie? Does it amplify the flavor of the strawberries and/or bananas?


How much would someone suggest adding if I do not want the juice flavor to overpower the smoothie?


Thank you!


",<flavor><juice><bananas><smoothie><strawberries>,2012-04-19 04:01:56.597,23201,10,"Apple juice will give you very little additional taste, but it will sweeten your smoothie. Especially filtered apple juice has a rather subtle flavor which is easily covered by other fruit flavors. Juice producers use this to make their juices cheaper - if a juice advertises 100% fruit, and a flavor from an expensive, non-juicy fruit like strawberries, it is usually a blend of a small amount of strawberry juice and a large amount of apple juice (this is not fraud, the ingredients are listed on the package if you care to read it). Apple juice is normally made from low-acid apples, and it tastes quite sweet, so it is useful not only for bulking, but also for sweetening blends made with sour juices like elderberry, cranberry, etc. In a smoothie, it will have the same effect as in a juice blend, plus a diluting effect, as it is less viscous than your other ingredients. It won't amplify the flavor of the smoothie, it will even reduce it, as sugar tends to suppress other flavors in general. But the reduction won't be too big, and you might find the overall result better if you are accustomed to heavily sweetened food. You can also remove the sugar if you use apple juice - I wouldn't put it there anyway, even without juice. 


Orange juice is much more acidic than apple juice, and it has a stronger aroma. It will add an orange flavor to your smoothie. I would count this as an advantage, because orange flavor goes especially well with bananas and is OK with strawberries too. It will also make the smoothie taste more sour, and again dilute it. Overall, the effect will be pleasant. As for what constitutes ""overpowering"" the taste, I think this is subjective. You should just experiment, adding a the juice in small proportions, until you have achieved the ratio which tastes good for you.

In short: Thermomix is okay but leads to a warmer dough than others because of the motor being placed right below the bowl.


Others knead from above, so the dough stays cooler. Cooler dough means more time to proof, means more taste in your bread.


If you want your appliance mainly for kneading, there are better alternatives. He recommends the Kenwood Major or Kenwood Cooking Chef. The Cooking Chef has the advantage of a heating element (like the Thermomix), which is useful for special baking stuff like a ""Malzstück"" (malt-piece?, introduces a malty taste and needs cooking for longer time on a precise temperature).

10,What is the effect of adding eggs to a pastry dough?,"As I understand it, making dough is really the process of hydrating flour so that a gluten network can be formed and the dough structure emerges.
Pastry dough usually adds butter in order both to reduce the amount of gluten formed and also to interleave sheets of fat to sheets of gluten to make it crumbly and oh so good.


What I don't understand is what eggs do to the dough. Most American apple pie recipes use no eggs for their dough, but almost all italian pastry dough (pastafrolla) use an abudance of eggs in lieu of some water.
What do these eggs do to the flour/butter mix? Do they increase gluten formation or decrease it, or no effect at all?


",<dough><pie><pastry><apple-pie>,2013-12-09 06:47:57.270,40091,9,"While many bread and pastry products do depend critically on the formation and management of gluten from wheat flours, this is not universally true.


Some types of pastry have structure dependent more on the starch networks which is the other major component of wheat flours; the texture and properties of these pastries is often dependent on the gross mechanical manipulation of the structures, depending on how the product is manipulated.


American style pie crust is a case in point. Flaky pie crust is generally manipulated in a manner which minimizes gluten production: low hydration, resting periods, and minimal mechanical manipulation.


The structure and flakiness emerges because the dough is essentially a series of butter flakes or bits, coated in starch. When baked, the starches gelate and steam from the dough pushes the butter pockets apart before the butter is fully melted and integrates into the dough structure. This is not dependent on gluten formation.


Taking [La Cucina Italiana's pasta frola recipe](http://lacucinaitalianamagazine.com/recipe/pasta_frolla) as typical, it appears that pasta frola has more in common with flaky pie crust than it does with bread or puff pastry, where gluten formation is key.


The egg in the dough will contribute *mostly* water (eggs are [75% water](http://urbanext.illinois.edu/eggs/res16-egg.html)). The remainder is primarily proteins (from the albumen in the egg white, and fats from the yolk).


This will somewhat tenderize the final pastry, and contribute an eggy flavor. It certainly does interfere with gluten formation, helping prevent a tough outcome, except in this application, gluten formation simply is not key. It will also contribute to the final color, both from the yellow pigments in the yolk, and by slightly promoting browning.

2,Must a lid for a pot used for steaming be vented?,"This is a follow-up to my earlier question about [steaming using the Instant Pot](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/77593/why-does-the-instant-pot-use-pressure-while-steaming). The answer there said that the ""steam"" function of the Instant Pot was only for pressure steaming; for ordinary steaming, one needed the optional [lid](https://instantpot.com/store/product.php?productid=13) that has a small hole for a steaming vent. 


I have a lid that fits the Instant Pot exactly, but it lacks the steam release vent. How much does this matter? [This question](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/35345/will-a-lid-with-a-hole-in-it-work-with-a-crock-pot) suggests that the venting holes in lids are generally too small to make much of a difference; but that was in the context of slow cooking, which generates far less steam. For steaming, would the absence of a vent cause too much steam to remain in the pot? Would this in turn affect the food being prepared? 


As an experiment, I tried steaming [idlis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idli) in the Instant Pot using the lid I have. I used store-bought batter that simply needed to be poured into the [idli molds](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0032RH696) and then steamed for 7–8 minutes. I steamed the idlis for 8 minutes. During the steaming, the lid ""danced"" a little on the pot rim and steam was noticeably escaping. The idlis came out okay, but were a little sticky on the bottom. I'm wondering whether the lack of a vent hole on the lid could have caused this, or whether I should look elsewhere. 


",<equipment><steaming>,2017-01-23 05:22:23.670,77706,4,"If a lid doesn't have a vent and the pot does not have any sort of locking mechanism like a pressure cooker, then the pressure of the steam inside will lift the lid off the pot and steam will escape.

5,What are recommendable coffee roast types for Aeropress?,"Many tutorials on brewing coffee with the aeropress cover the optimal water temperature, water volume/weight, grind, for making a decent cup of coffee.


What none of them seem to cover is **what type of roast is recommendable (dark roast/light roast) or what coffee bean type (Arabica or Robusta/Arabica mixture) is well suited for the Aeropress**. 


For example, the compression of the result suggests that Espresso beans/powder may be suitable, which are fairly darkly roasted, but fine ground when bought as powder. Then there is the standard coffee powder, which is medium ground and medium roasted. And finally there are also special Mokka coffee powders available, which are coarse ground but dark roasted.


What I can tell so far is that a medium/coarse ground, medium/light organic roast coffee powder tastes not so well in the Aeropress despite the fact that filter coffee made with it is actually quite OK. 


Note that concrete brands listed here probably would not help (me), unless they are available in central Europe. Others may find them useful, though.


",<coffee>,2014-06-20 08:45:15.517,45017,5,"Coffee taste is indeed subjective. However, there are some things you can look for since the added pressure (versus drip) can force extraction of flavours you don't like. Below are some of the drivers (Disclaimer, I don't use the Aeropress):


* **Oily beans**: Towards the end of the roasting process the coffee oil can seep out (sweat) and you end up with beans that look wet. This may turn out ok taste with drip coffee, not so much for espresso types.
* **Roast Colour:** Drip coffee roasts tend to actually be darker and most espresso roasts are usually lighter in colour (see illy or LaVazza Oro). This may be to compensate for the forces of added pressure extracting deeper and more into the bean. There are exceptions to this (Bar Mexico in Naples uses dark roast but on a manual lever machine).
* **Bean Type:** Aeropress might handle some robusta (similar to Muka) as opposed to pure Arabica. More than 40% and imo your coffee will taste like earth.
* **Grind Size:** Each bean type and locale and roast level will require minute grinder setting changes. You can make the best roasted beans taste awful with the wrong grind. Try varying your grind from fine to super fine and experiment. Usually the higher pressure requires finer grind with the exception of turkish coffee.
* **Dosage:** To the get right extraction, a balance of pressure, grind size, and dosage is required. Good cafes measure their dosage to ~0.1gram when setting their grinder. If you find the coffee starting to clear up too fast in your extraction try increasing the dose.

If you stick to the use by date, and in particular the ""once open use within..."" instructions (which are probably to use within a few days) you should be fine.

6,Brining chicken wings,"I'm trying to figure out how to brine chicken wings (for hot wings) and have some questions about brine:


1. What is the minimum and maximum amount of salt to water ratio to make a brine?
2. Does brine have to be boiled? I've seen some brine recipes that call for the solution to be brought to a boil, then cool. Can't I just stir the solution until the salt and water are fully incorporated?
3. Some brine solutions add ingredients other than salt. When does such a solution become a marinade instead of a brine? And what's the difference?


",<chicken>,2013-01-05 16:43:55.770,29763,5,"*What is the minimum and maximum amount of salt to water ratio to make a brine?*


This is a very complicated question--in the chemical sense, salt dissolved in water is a brine, but they can vary in concentration (usually measured in percentage of salt by weight).


For the culinary purpose of seasoning and helping meat cuts stay moist, it varies considerably; the stronger the brine, the shorter the brining time, in general, although below a certain threshold you are going have little effect. Too much salt in the brine, and it will get to the point where you are are wet curing, and the product will start to take on hammy textures and flavors.


A good range for culinary brines is about 3-5%, depending on the length of time you intend to brine, and the size of the cuts being brined.


*Does brine have to be boiled? I've seen some brine recipes that call for the solution to be brought to a boil, then cool. Can't I just stir the solution until the salt and water are fully incorporated?*


No, you don't have to boil the brine; doing so is for ease in dissolving the salt (and possibly sugar).


For safety, you only want to brine in cold brine, so you would then need to cool a previously boiled brine. This is usually done by boiling half the water weight with the salt/sugar, and then adding the other half of the weight of water as ice after.


*Some brine solutions add ingredients other than salt. When does such a solution become a marinade instead of a brine? And what's the difference?*


Marinade is not defined scientifically, so there is no formal distinction. It is a matter of culinary purpose. My personal take is that brines are made of water, salt, and sugar, and possibly one or two flavorants; marinades often have an oil, dairy, or acid (such as orange juice or vinegar) base, although there is considerable variation.


Marinades are about adding flavor (usually), and possibly tenderizing (when acid, or an enzymatic actor such as pineapple juice is present). Marinades act at the surface of the food product.


If the primary purpose is to help the meat stay juicy, and to season it, the application is brining, so call it brine. Brines, with enough time, will affect deep into the meet, although there is some argument over what the exact scientific mechanism is.


The thing is, despite the myth, brining does not help *flavor* (as opposed to salt, for seasoning) enter the meat--adding extra ingredients to it beyond salt, sugar, and water is not generally helpful, as these flavors will not pass the cell walls (they are too large at the molecular scale), so they don't actually have much if any effect on the meat other than at the very surface.

7,How to approximate the Maillard temperature (154°C) in a pan?,"Are there any common (non-toxic) household substances with boiling or smoke points close to the temperature at which the Maillard reaction occurs, 154°C?


I want to be able to check that my pan is around this temperature without using a thermometer before frying a steak.


",<frying><temperature><maillard>,2011-06-07 14:29:48.030,15303,6,"The Maillard reaction *begins* around 150° C. You do not need that exact temperature. Usually, you don't even *want* that exact temperature; even baking temperatures usually hover around 175-200° C (350-400° F), and those temperatures are held for 20 minutes or more. Pan-frying is almost always a fast cooking process lasting no longer than 10 minutes.


Thus, almost every cooking oil has a smoke point at or around the ideal temperature. Butter is a bit too low around 121-149° C (250-300° F), but the vast majority of liquid oils - peanut, sunflower, corn, canola, sesame, even EVOO - all have smoke points from 150-260° C (300-500° F).


See Wikipedia's [list of smoke points](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_point) for a fairly complete list. Avoid butter and *unrefined* flaxseed/safflower/sunflower oil (commercially-bottled oil is almost always refined, except for EVOO).


Of course, this doesn't say anything about cooking time or sticking. When we talk about frying or sautéing in oil (i.e. to get the Maillard reaction going), we usually want a quick *sear*, and for that you really want to get the pan screaming hot so that you can get a good sear on the outside without doing much to the inside. Clarified butter, coconut oil, or any other of the highly-refined oils are the best for that purpose.


If you're really trying to prolong the cooking time, i.e. pan-frying a chicken breast all the way through, then I guess you'd stick with a lower smoke point oil, such as EVOO or unrefined peanut or sesame.

11,Should you ever add aromatic veggies to a dish without sauteing them first?,"Many recipes and cooking blog posts emphasize the importance of sauteing aromatic veggies to release their flavor and reduce the bite. This gave me the impression that when aromatic veggies are involved, the order of saute>raw is always preferred. I mean - why would you ever NOT want to release the aroma in a veg?


Yet for example I see many cooks that add the onions to a dish without sauteing first. Is there an advantage to not sauteing aromatic veggies, or is it always preferred to saute them? If so, how can you tell according to the dish?


",<flavor><vegetables><sauteing><stir-fry>,2016-02-02 10:44:24.727,66133,16,"If the recipes were truly interesting in 'releasing the flavors', they'd be sweating the onions, not sauteing them. Sauté is a higher-heat method that will cook the vegetables to create other chemical compounds, thus changing their flavor.


In the case of garlic and onions, this cooking makes them dramatically sweeter. But sometimes you don't want that -- you may want the sharp bite of the garlic, and to do that, you need to add it near the end of cooking, without it having been cooked.


Also of note is that if you are cooking in an acid (such as tomatoes), the acid will slow or possibly stop the vegetables from softening ... so if you want your onions to dissolve into the sauce, they need to be cooked first. If you them to add some chunkiness and the possible burst of onion when someone bites in, you want to add it later.


As others have noted -- in many cases, you'll add a given ingredient twice -- maybe some garlic to mellow out at the beginning of cooking, and then a crushed clove or two towards the end of the cooking.

11,What's in a 'Paella'?,"Answering [this question](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/17728/why-do-you-need-to-fry-onions-and-garlic-before-adding-other-ingredients-to-a-dis), I made an ass of myself claiming that 


1. Onions are not used in a real Paella.
2. Tomatoes neither.
3. Paprika / Pimentón neither as this will overpower the saffron flavor.


I've seen loads of recipes with all of these ingredients in some way or other (and I posted a recipe with all of these ingredients :-( ).


As I understand it, onions are not used because the will 'pass' the rice. I have no idea whether this is true or not, but I've never eaten a paella with onions. Not that I usually eat paella.


The tomatoes and pimentón will impart too much flavor so it will overpower the saffron taste (by far the most expensive spice on earth). Food coloring can be used to make the paella 'saffron' yellow.


The question is, what defines a real paella? One definition of paella is the 'pan' or 'skillet' itself, meaning that whatever rice dish you make in it can be called paella, but I'd rather have a more 'traditional' view as to what ingredients can or cannot/should or shouldn't be used.


* Onions (yes or no)
* Tomato (yes or no)
* Paprika (no :-)
* Saffron (yes)

The meats are snails and rabbit, and she does call for an onion, but it's only used to steep for a while in the broth, and later discarded. She includes a single tomato which is cooked down with green peppers and garlic. Most of her other *paella* recipes include onion in this step, but it is notably absent from this recipe. She also calls for lima beans and ""wide, flat string beans"", and serve the dish with scallions on the side.

4,"Sticky, messy sourdough: overfermented, or ambient factors?","I've made the same sourdough bread a dozen times before, with small variations in parameters:


* 360g white flour
* 240g whole wheat flour
* 390g water


That's a 65% dough with 60% white and 40% whole wheat flour. I've been using the sponge method wherein the night before baking, I'm mixing half the flour (300g) with the water and 60g stiff (100%) sourdough starter.


The next morning I mix in the rest of the flour, 2% salt, and knead by hand.


This has worked well throughout March-May, but the last two times I attempted it I'm having trouble with dough that is sticky, stretchy, and a nightmare to handle.


Last time I ventured for 70% hydration and 1:1 white to whole wheat flour and it got very messy and I abandoned it.


Now, when I'm sticking to my tried recipe, I'm still having the same issue:


[![sticky dough on bench](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xJJT1.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xJJT1.jpg)


No matter how much extra flour I incorporate, the dough will not become more manageable... it seems it's ready to swallow an entire pack! 


Do you think it could be:


* the sponge, which was left at room temp. for about 10hrs, is overfermented? (I don't have a picture, but it looked normal, bubbles like a tapioca pudding, no signs of hooch)
* the ambient humidity has messed up the recipe in a *major* way?
* a combination of both?


It's warmer (25C) and wetter (55-65%) here this rainy June as opposed to ~22C / 40%.
If the sponge is overfermented, does halving the starter help in any meaningful way? Or should I give it less time?


If the flour has been soaking up water in the pantry, how much water should you add to get a predictable result? Do I just weigh a pack of flour and work out how much extra water it holds?


As for The Blob, do I continue to incorporate flour into it and hope it starts holding shape, or does an overfermented sponge preclude me from getting a decent loaf?


### Update


I've been using the same brand of white and whole wheat flours throughout. Nothing substantial about the technique has changed. I knead the bread by hand 10-15 mins through a series of smear-scrape-twist motions, as shown below in the River Cottage Bread Handbook:


![kneading technique](https://i.stack.imgur.com/YA2ox.jpg)


65% hydration with 60-40% flour mix was my safe space, and the dough just doesn't seem to come together as of late.


",<bread><dough><sourdough>,2020-06-20 07:55:35.267,109173,2,"This is a bit unusual, but from your picture, I think your long rise at a high temperature (25C) has indeed overfermented your sponge. It's not so much that the yeast is used up: in fact it might still be active. The problem is that the gluten that developed in the first few hours has been broken down in the long fermentation. Hence the lack of structure. You can't fix this by adding any small amount of flour.


Instead you could use this dough as preferment. Then you will need to add plenty more flour and water (maybe matching the amounts already used) and knead again, or use a no-knead rise (but not 10 hours) to develop gluten.

2,Do professional chefs ever suffer food poisoning?,"Quite often you see celebrity and professional chefs taste the meat or sauce from a dish that is clearly not fully cooked. Is there a different length of time you should wait before sampling an uncooked dish (e.g. beef versus chicken) and do chefs ever suffer food poisoning for the sake of their art?


",<food-safety><professional>,2019-10-01 20:57:59.853,102680,3,"More opinion than a back up factual answer, but I knew a Cordon Bleu and CCI trained chef who stated one of his first days in professional training he was required to eat a raw chicken breast. The reasoning: He was expected at all times to have a kitchen that was clean enough and product that was fresh and high enough quality that he could do so. That if he was not confident enough that he would not get sick from eating something raw, that her was never to serve it to someone else. No matter how diligent he was, there would be times that he would serve something under-cooked or cross contaminated to a customer, so he had to have that confidence that the odds of them getting sick even with a mistake were low.


Using this level of product and practices costs more, and is part of the reason we have to pay more for items from a high quality place. To protect themselves they must do all they can to protect you. In normal practice though, they are taking very small tastes. They have trained tastes and can recognize spicing issues and such with a small enough sample to not be high risk. Sure, it can happen and they may end up sick, but the odds on any given sample are low and it is their profession. One of the challenges at home is for us to also learn to make those judgements in taste from a small sample while limiting the risks of cross contamination. I would not eat a piece of raw chicken because I don't have access to the quality and assured freshness that say a Gordon Ramsey has. Notice though, he tests under cooked, but does not serve that way and will not eat that way when served. In my kitchen I will taste test repeatedly for fear of killing flavor with too much salt for instance and can usually tell with a pretty small taste. I do not tend to hesitate even though I have a low tolerance to tainted food due to having gotten food poisoning more than once as a kid. 


Where many of us especially struggle compared to a quality professional though is knowing how flavor will develop as the dish continues to cook, such as tasting early in a sauce. In this case it takes a lot of practice to mentally extrapolate how the flavors will finish when tasting early, and yet that is when you prefer to have many flavors added so the meld together better. That you can only gain through practice, which means even more tasting and even more need for care in selection high quality items and in avoiding contamination.

100 Bread Flour

Note that if using metric measurements (g or mL) then the weight vs. volume measurements actually *are* the same for water. So consider using metric for baking, if you can, because that way the conversions are much easier and you can measure out your liquids in a measuring cup without having to do any conversion math.

5,Why is it advised to freeze meat before eating as opposed to eating it fresh?,"I am not sure, is it right to wrong ""It is not good to eat meat just after killing, it should be stored and deep freezed for at least 24 hours"". But I had heard same like this through national media. What could be the logic behind this ?


",<food-safety><meat><freezing><raw-meat>,2014-07-28 11:02:10.667,45934,5,"What kind of meat is it, maybe pork? 


There are many kinds of pathogens in meat. One type are bacteria. They don't die from cold temperatures (not even freezing), but die from high heat. Unfortunately, heating the meat throughout so it's hot enough to kill all bacteria will turn it into a shoesole. So, meat is cooked to slightly lower temperatures which are capable of killing most, but not all bacteria. And the surface of the meat comes into contact with the pan, so it gets much hotter than the inside. Because the surface is where the bacteria are (they came onto the meat after it was butchered), they die in the hot pan. 


But there are other pathogens beside bacteria. One class are parasites. They also die from high heat. But they don't sit on the surface of the meat, they were living inside the tissue of the animal before it was slaughtered. So, if you bring a contaminated steak to 55 Celsius internal temperature, but accidentally stick your thermometer in a too thin part of the meat - or don't use a thermometer and hope that you can judge meat doneness by feel - it can happen that a parasite snuggled in the thickest part survives. And some domestic animal parasites can also use the human as a host, causing all kinds of ugly health problems. A prime examples would be trichinosis, a disease caused by a pig parasite. 


Parasites are rather rare in industrial food production, because there are ways to heal them in the living animal. You almost never get into contact with them, while each piece of meat you buy is teeming with disease-causing bacteria. So parasites are not in the spotlight of food safety, the typical rules are created to protect against bacteria. Given the lack of trichinosis epidemics lately, it seems to work. 


But if there is a high chance that you get contaminated meat, you can consider freezing the meat. Unlike bacteria, parasites die when frozen solid, and stop being a danger to you. 


I haven't heard of such a wave of advice in the media, it could be that there was a single high-profile case of parasite illness in your country, or that there has been a slowly growing epidemic. Or also that there always has been some danger due to the way animals are typically held (your description of eating right away reminds me of a family slaughtering pigs they raised themselves, in which case there is no vet inspecting the meat), but that consumer rights groups have started a media campaign to bring the situation into public attention. 


Beside pork, there is high parasite risk in wild hunted game, as well as many kinds of sea food. Sheep can also carry some, but they are more likely to be in the organ meat, not the muscle (e.g. liver flukes). AFAIK, beef and chicken are not typical hosts to dangerous parasites. Update: As Mischa Arefiev points out, there is a type of tapeworm which lives in beef. Freezing is effective against it too.

16,Cooking and storing rice for a whole week,"I work long hours and my commute to work is about 2 hours long, when I get home, I basically grab a bite to eat and sleep.


Recently though I have learned to cook a big portion of a meal to last me through the whole week. This way I can eat healthy instead of going to Chicken Zone (my local fried chicken shop).


I have a couple questions with regards to Rice:


1. How do you cook it perfectly (each and everytime) so that its softness is 'just right' and each grain is not stuck to the other? I use a Gas Cooker/Oven and my rice is Tilda Basmati.
2. How can I safely store it in the fridge to last a week?

0,Should hands be washed after touching the outside of an egg shell?(UK),"Say someone was to remove some eggs from their box to place them in the fridge. Assume this is in Britain(where eggs aren't cleaned before sold, I believe).
Is there a risk of salmonella spreading if they do not wash their hands afterwards?


What if they washed their hands, but with cold water and no soap, then dried them on a towel?


Thanks,
Anthony.


",<food-safety><eggs>,2016-01-03 17:56:37.950,65501,1,"Would you wash your hands after handing chicken poop? How about if you were digging around in the straw or dirt where chickens live? That's where your eggs come from.


Contrary to popular belief, chicken eggs generally aren't contaminated by feces before they exit the chicken -- the two pathways by which feces and eggs come out do intersect near the ""exit,"" but because of the geometry, it's uncommon for feces to get on the egg there. Nevertheless, if the chicken has feces on its feathers as it moves around while laying, or if feces are around the place where it's laying, there could be contamination. In close quarters where most laying hens live, it's quite common. Even in so-called ""free range"" situations, studies have indicated that around 30% of eggs are contaminated on their surfaces by something undesirable, from feces to residue from previously broken eggs in the area. If any of the chickens there happen to be sick with *Salmonella*, it's now on the eggshell.


In the UK, most eggs are not washed. Therefore, when you handle intact eggs, you are touching whatever materials the eggs touched. Just because there isn't visible soiling on the egg doesn't mean there isn't a thin film of *Salmonella* or other bacteria present. And in fact it is well-known that *Salmonella* are commonly found on unwashed eggshells.


Now, is it likely that you could get sick just from those bacteria on your hands? Probably not. The concentration is likely nowhere high enough. The main problem could occur if you unintentionally transfer some of that bacteria to a better growth medium. Studies have also shown that it is possible for bacteria on the external eggshell to contaminate the contents of the egg while breaking, and if the raw eggs are left to sit for a long time or combined with something where the bacteria can grow, illness could result.


If such things can happen during minimal and unintentional contact between egg shells and their contents during breaking an egg, it's certainly possible for your hands to also transmit bacteria (cross contamination), particularly if they were wet before you handled the egg or something and you then touch another surface or some food where the bacteria can start to multiply.


Is it likely? Probably not in most cases. In terms of ""risky"" kitchen behavior, it's relatively low on the list. The example I'm giving here includes a worst-case scenario. But personally I'd treat it as if you were picking up some random item dropped on the ground in a chicken coop. If you would wash your hands then, you should probably wash your hands after handling (unwashed) eggs.


But don't listen to me. [Here's some info](http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/publication/eggscaterers.pdf) from the UK Food Standards Agency:



> 
> Remember, salmonella bacteria can be on the shell as well as inside

Also, by the way, the question mentions removing eggs from a box to store in the fridge. Most food safety organizations don't recommend that for the same reasons -- they could come in contact with other foods and/or leave residue on surfaces in the fridge. It's better to keep them in the box they came in.

2,What aspects of a fridge most affect the quality/taste of food?,"I am buying a refrigerator. Aside from the usual non-culinary criteria (size, style, energy efficiency, cost), are there particular features/designs that will affect the taste of my refrigerated cooking ingredients (meat, seafood, produce, dairy, eggs, etc)?


For example:


* Since various ingredients are optimally preserved in different conditions (temperature/humidity/light), are there fridges that make it easier, e.g. by having different compartments?
* Is it important to have different compartments to prevent ingredients from interacting with each other?


Are any of these a major consideration for you when shopping for a fridge?


",<refrigerator>,2014-06-03 03:36:24.440,44625,3,"There are a number of other threads here with some bearing on this question, including:


[What is the ideal fridge temperature](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/12013/what-is-the-ideal-fridge-temperature)


[Can food spoil at cold temperatures?](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/36635/can-food-spoil-at-cold-temperatures)

[Does having spoiling food in your fridge cause other food to spoil faster?](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/20121/does-having-spoiling-food-in-your-fridge-cause-other-food-to-spoil-faster)


What we can glean from all of these is that temperature control is critical, and can vary between different models. You want a refrigerator that can reliably maintain a consistent temperature without wide temperature spikes, and you probably want a relatively low differential between different parts of the box (so that, for instance, items in the bottom compartment don't freeze while items on the top shelf spoil). Different compartments can help in isolating foods from one another, but they would be *especially* valuable if their temperature and humidity could can be independently adjusted to allow for minute control.


Also, keeping your fridge clean is important, so that mold, bacteria, and so on can't collect and spoil your fresh new produce; thus you want a model that can be readily disassembled and scrubbed. Easily removable shelves, compartments, and so on would be beneficial, and they should be made from easy-to-clean plastics or glass with minimal texture. At the same time, these need to be sturdy and adjustable, so that you can thaw that 20-pound turkey without having to sacrifice too much other space or breaking a shelf.


Speaking as not just a chef, but as a home bartender, I also want adjustable space inside the door(s) so that I can store a variety of differently-sized bottles upright. But that's more for convenience and efficient storage than it is about taste or quality.

14,Is unnecessary refrigeration problematic?,"Our local grocery store's produce section has a few areas of refrigerated produce along the walls--mostly ""wet"" vegetables like lettuce, squash, peppers, green beans, etc. The rest, in the middle of the produce section is simply on shelves in bins, like potatoes, onions, corn and bananas.


For the most part, our home storage tends to follow the store's--we keep lettuce in the crisper and onions out.


However, there are a few pieces of produce that tend to generate some controversy in our house, and they tend to be small and round, like grapes, cherries, and berries. The questionable item this week is blueberries. My tendency is to follow the store's practice of leaving this out, whereas my wife seems convinced they will rot in a matter of hours and insists they should be refrigerated.


I'm more or less satisfied with refrigerating them--as long as it won't cause a problem. I've heard that some items will actually go soft faster, or lose flavor, if stored cold.


",<refrigerator><produce>,2011-05-26 12:35:01.037,15096,4,"Just to clarify a couple of things that others have said -


The skin of any vegetable or fruit has natural defences against microorganisms, particularly moulds - if you wash your food the minute you get it home, you reduce its keeping qualities. Wash things as needed, immediately before using or eating them, and they will keep longer than if you wash them in bulk. 


Never neglect the washing, because they may have been sprayed with something to improve their shelf life - and remember this includes things like the peel of citrus fruits, which is often ignored by the pros.


It is a fact that chilling foods can initiate mould growth, which will manifest itself quite quickly if the temperature is raised. If food was chilled when you bought it, keep it that way and the mould growth will be slowed down. If you put it in the chiller, keep it there until you use it.


If you bought food at room temperature and it quickly goes mouldy, you can usually bet that it was chilled in transit.

7,Why does my pizza dough stick to my peel?,"I've been experimenting with Neapolitan pizza dough([recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/03/jim-laheys-no-knead-pizza-dough-recipe.html)) and what I would call a normal wooden peel([here](http://amzn.com/B0000VLZ2G)). I have run into trouble transferring the pizza from the peel to my [baking steel](http://bakingsteel.com/) in the oven on about 10% of my pizzas. Usually what happens is I'm fine transferring the first 1-2 pizzas, but by the 3rd or 4th in a row(within 20mins or so) the pizza sticks to the peel and causes a huge mess in the oven and me to throw out the dough.


The way I am making dough is about as wet as I can make it, I add about 20-30g to the existing recipe noted above to make it extra wet. I flour the peel, dough, my hands, and working surface quite liberally with a [dredge](http://amzn.com/B001CIELHW). I stretch the dough about as far as possible for 200g pizza, until it almost tears.


I did find a tip on YouTube where they recommended lifting up the edge of the dough after it is prepared on the peel, and blowing under the pizza dough to ""lift"" it up before trying to launch it off of the peel. I do this each time and still run into my issue.


Note - I do own an aluminum peel as well, but the first and only time I tried that to transfer the dough into the oven I failed so I'm too afraid to try it again without further advice on the matter([this peel](http://amzn.com/B002JPJ0QY)))

9,Rules for refreezing food,"What are the general rules regarding when can you refreeze food that was frozen and then thawed in the fridge? and what are the reasons behind them? (Hygiene? Food quality?). Let's assume for the sake of the argument that the items were in a non-frozen state only a few hours.


To be more specific, I'm interested in the application of these rules for 
- Ginger garlic paste
- Dough
- Indian Curries
- Green Chilly paste
- Frozen green peas


",<food-safety><freezing><garlic>,2014-03-24 14:46:04.050,42969,15,"There are two different issues, which have separate drivers. There are no specific rules, just consequences of the thaw and freezing cycles on each food--but it is always better to minimize the number of cycles to maintain quality.


Safety
------


From a safety point of view, the rule is any perishable food (one that is not fairly stable at room temperature such as cold cereal or pretzels) should have its time in the so-called danger zone (40-140 F, 4-60 C) limited to no more than two total hours over its lifetime. This prevents pathogens, which grow exponentially, from having sufficient time in hospitable conditions to grow and create enough toxins to be harmful.


So if you have something at room temperature for one hour and then freeze it, it would have one hour left on the clock when you thaw it out. The rule is counted analogous for items which you defrost in the refrigerator - freezing ""stops the clock"", any time spent out of the freezer, be it during thawing or after it, counts towards it, and times between freezing ""cycles"" add up.


(Note that as people will no doubt otherwise insist on pointing out: these recommendations are extremely conservative, and are meant to protect the general public health. You must determine your own willingness to accept risk.)


Quality
-------


In terms of quality, there are two main issues that occur in freezing: ice crystal formation, and freezer burn. Additionally, condensation can be a minor issue upon thawing.


### Ice Damage


As you freeze food, the water in it freezes (this is obvious). What may not be obvious is that this frozen water is in crystals, which are hard and sharp, and can penetrate cell walls of meat and vegetables. This will cause meats to loose moisture on being thawed, and vegetables to weep and become more limp and flaccid. The more slowly the food is frozen (due to a warmer freezer compartment), the worse the damage is.


Some foods, like fresh vegetables are very sensitive to this type of damage (this is why most freezing directions for vegetables include blanching). Meats are also somewhat sensitive, but it is not as severe, especially if you take steps to freeze them *quickly* (freeze in a single layer, set your freezer to its coldest temperature).


Many home freezers are also auto-defrost, which means they periodically warm up to get rid of accumulated frost, and then cool down again. This can cause ice crystal growth over time. Chest freezers without auto-defrost do not suffer this problem, but at the cost of requiring manual defrosting periodically.


Food frozen commercially is often done in blast chillers which have forced air circulation and colder temperatures than are achievable with home freezers and so freeze food much more rapidly than is possible at home, resulting in a higher quality product as long as the frozen state is maintained well.


Other foods such as purees or soups suffer little from ice crystal damage, and so are not as much of an issue.


### Freezer Burn


Freezer burn happens when water *sublimates* (evaporates directly from the frozen state to vapor). This dries out the food, giving it a leathery, burned appearance. It is the same mechanism used intentionally in creating freeze dried foods (although that is usually done more rapidly and under a partial vacuum, to improve quality).


You can mitigate or prevent freezer burn by wrapping food quite tightly, so there is not room for air circulation at its surface. This may involve multiple layers such as film wrap, followed by aluminum foil.


### Condensation


Some foods, like cheesecakes, will react poorly to getting wet. If thawed unwrapped, water may condense directly on the food, beading on its surface and reducing the quality.


If you do freeze a food like this, you want to wrap it very well (which also helps with freezer burn), and fully thaw it before unwrapping to keep the condensation off the surface of the food.


Specific Examples
-----------------


Of the specific examples you have enumerated:


* Ginger garlic paste, green chili paste -- as a paste, it is already soft and somewhat liquid, so ice damage is not really an issue.
* Dough -- Most doughs freeze well, and don't have a cell structure to disrupt. If the dough is an active yeast dough, multiple cycles are going to slowly reduce the effectiveness of the yeast by killing off some each cycle.
* Curries -- Cooked food in sauces, especially braises which many curries are, usually freeze extremely well. They are not subject to much ice damage, as they are already softened during the cooking process.
* Frozen green peas -- If commercially frozen, they will have minimal damage, and are already blanched. If you have blanched them, the cell walls will already be weakened. Still, many people are very sensitive to the quality of their peas, so this is one of the foods that is more likely to give you poor outcomes.


Better Practice
---------------


A far better practice than thawing and refreezing is to freeze in smaller containers (such as four 1 quart zipper type bags of stock, instead of one large gallon container).


This will allow you to take out only what you need, minimizing handling (for safety) and thaw/freeze cycles for food quality.


It is also far more convenient than having to thaw the food, since you have less to thaw (which is faster). Some foods can even me used directly from the frozen state if you don't have to thaw them in order to get the amount you require.

***Now trying to unwind the folklore....***


**(A) What is the toxicity of cyanide?**


Cyanide in the body is an anion, which has a negative charge. In order to balance the charge a cation, a positive charged ion must be present too. Since beans would be eaten let's look at the toxicity of sodium cyanide. 


The dose of [sodium cyanide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_cyanide) which would kill 50% of the subjects (LD-50) is about 15 mg/kg of body weight for mammals. But by weight sodium cyanide is 47% sodium and 53% cyanide. So the lethal dose for cyanide itself would be about 7mg/kg. 


So a 154 pound person weighs 70 kg (2.2 lbs per kg). 70\*7 is approximately 500 mg or 0.5 grams. 


**(B) Does the cyanide content of lima beans vary?**


Yes. Supposedly the varieties of lima beans consumed in the US (and presumably Canada) are specifically chosen to be low in cyanide. 


Cyanide in ""lima beans [varies] between 15 and 500 mg HCN/kg fresh weight (Bickerstaff, 2003)"" quoted from:


(5) <http://members.ecetoc.org/Documents/Document/JACC%20053%20Vol%20I.pdf>


But I can find the original source by Bickerstaff in the article.


**(C) How much does cooking reduce the cyanide?**


There is a paper which notes that in other foods the cyanogenic glycosides are 100% destroyed by cooking. 


(6) <http://www.onlineresearchjournals.org/JBFSR/pdf/2013/jan/Onyeike%20et%20al..pdf>


**(D) How does the bean produce cyanide?**


The cyanide in lima beans is present as ""pure"" cyanide, but a cyanide compound called a cyanogenic glycoside. Lima beans contain two such compounds, [linamarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linamarin) and [lotaustralin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotaustralin)

4,"Should you freeze pastry lukewarm? If so, why?","I have a book about baking in general. In the chapter 'Preserving pastry in the freezer' is the following sentence (I translated it for practical reasons):

There is no information why you shouldn't let it cool completely. It's the first time I've heard this (and it's a pretty famous and often used book here; it *could* be wrong though). 


While I was searching on this site whether the question was already asked, I've found [this](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/14016/how-to-properly-freeze-cake) question. The accepted answer claims the opposite.


So, I want to know if the claim in my book is correct and why or why not.


",<bread><freezing><cake><dough><pastry>,2012-01-26 22:15:40.123,20824,5,"I think it's because freezing tend to dry things out. At lukewarm temperature, it's still 'steaming' a bit, which means evaporating liquid, so losing moist. If you can stop the drying out process at that point, the pastry won't be as dry as when you let it cool completely.
Of course, a too high temperature can do harm to already frozen things, or would cause condensation in the package, so that there would be ice formed.

1,Substitute for a Standing Mixer using a paddle,"Many times I'll find a great-looking recipe that calls for a standing mixer. I haven't made buying one a priority yet. Usually I will make it anyway, using my hand mixer with beaters.


I found one where I would be mixing cream cheese, sour cream, and mayonnaise with a paddle. Will it ruin the consistency/chemistry to use my hand mixer with beaters? Is there another suitable way to mix these ingredients?


",<mixing><stand-mixer>,2018-02-01 21:11:18.067,87451,6,"A paddle mixes denser ingredients vs a wisk attachment that will aerate light ingredients. Things mixed with a paddle are always intended to be completely mixed- as opposed to folding or cutting which aren't done with a mixer.


This means that you can use whatever you want to thoroughly mix those ingredients (as long as it doesn't melt them): a stand mixer, a hand mixer, a spoon, etc.


Most hand held mixers have much smaller motors than most stand mixers. They can't handle stiff doughs and you can destroy your mixer, stripping the gears or burning out the motor, if you attempt to overdrive it. Better quality hand mixers can handle almost anything a stand mixer can.


That said- any hand mixer should be able to handle cream cheese and mayo with no problem.


TL;DR


Go ahead. Your hand mixer should be able to handle those ingredients just fine without spoiling the recipe or damaging your mixer.

1,To what extent is curcumin destroyed by boiling?,"I came across a ""juice shot"" / ""anti inflammatory drink"" recepie the other day which lists the following ingredients : 


* lemon (in slices)
* ginger (in slices)
* turmeric (in slices)
* sugar
* water


The above ingredients should boil for 45 minutes, and then be ready to drink.


One of the advertised health boosters of this drink is curcumin (from the turmeric). However, does it withstand 45 minutes of boiling, or is the amount of curcumin reduced by the boiling?


",<boiling><nutrient-composition>,2016-02-03 18:16:37.647,66183,3,"Googling, I found [this report](ftp://ftp.fao.org/es/esn/jecfa/cta/CTA_61_Curcumin.pdf), presenting a chemical and technical analysis of curcumin. Skimming through it, it seems that degradation of the substance should not be a problem due to temperature, although the report doesn't say much about it except that it shouldn't be a problem:



> 
> Curcumin is stable in dry food. It is relatively stable to heat so it can be used in thermally treated foods.
> 
> 
> 


However, it warns about using it in solutions of a high pH, without stating which of the degradation products may be unfortunate to ingest. Furthermore curcumin is sensitive to light, so if you want as little as possible of it to degrade it is probably a good idea to keep a lid on the pan while you're heating the solution and consume it fairly quickly afterwards:



> 
> In native form curcumin is not suitable as a colouring agent in aqueous solutions of pH > 7

> 
> The principal colouring components of curcumin are not particularly stable to light, especially in solutions. After the photo-irradiation of compound 1, a cyclisation product was detected, as well as decomposition products, such as vanillic acid, vanillin, and ferulic acid (Sasaki et al, 1998). Commercial formulations of curcumin are available that are designed to minimize the inherent light instability.

With regards to the pH of your solution I don't think that should be a problem, as it is probably fairly acidic from juices of the lemon.

2,How do I avoid rice cookers emitting strange goo on my counter?,"With my rice cooker, I always have to put a paper towel underneath it before I start it, because it tends to make a mess. It creates piles of white watery starch goo. I don't really know how else to describe it other than the title. It's not really overflowing, since it occurs even when the rice cooker only has a small amount of rice in it - it looks like it's condensing from the air or something. 


I usually just measure in rice and water, then turn it on and leave. Is this a common problem? Am I doing something wrong in the cooking process? Perhaps I have a bad rice cooker or cheap rice? What are some good rice cookers and/or cooking methods?


",<rice><rice-cooker>,2019-06-06 21:03:50.647,99409,4,"Some rice cookers have a vent on the side, and there's a little cup with it that clips in there to catch the starchy moisture that might escape during cooking.


If your rice cooker came with a small plastic cup (I say 'cup' as it's a container, but it's usually pretty flat so it doesn't stick out very far) that you couldn't figure out what it was for, this is likely your problem. It usually attaches near the hinge.


Not all rice cookers have them, though. My 10 cup does, but the little 2 cup that I got at a thrift store doesn't. (it vents from the top, and the lid lifts off completely)

14,"""Cooking"" with acid (ceviche)","At a tappas bar, I had shrimp ceviche. In this dish, the shrimp is ""cooked"" not by high temperature but by the citric acid of its marinade. This would be really fun to make at home. For such dishes, should you stick to tested recipes? Or is there a way to figure out: what kind of acids will work, what kinds of meats will work, and when the meat is sufficiently ""cooked""?


**Edit:** Added quotes around ""cooked"" since, as Bob pointed out, the meat is not cooked *per se*.


",<meat><food-science><fish><acidity>,2010-09-12 16:24:37.797,7255,12,"Ceviche is not exactly ""cooked"", but the acid causes the proteins to become [denatured](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denaturation_%28biochemistry%29) in a similar way. It may not kill all bacteria and parasites as effectively as cooking (with heat), so like sdg said, it's safest to use food that you would eat raw.


""Sushi grade"" can refer to the fat content of the fish (like the USDA grades for beef marbling) rather than an assurance of its safety, so don't rely on that to pick out ingredients. Saltwater fish should be frozen at sea both for freshness and to kill parasites, and I prefer to get individually quick frozen (IQF) shrimp both for their freshness and convenience. Saltwater fish at your local supermarket has been previously frozen, so you're usually better off just buying frozen fish and thawing it yourself, unless you're really pressed for time.


Freshwater fish should not be used in a raw preparation, including ceviche.

11,what is a good liquid to replace tequila with?,"I'm looking to try a marinade recipe I found recently that calls for tequila. However one of my friends is unable to consume alcohol. What would be a good flavorful liquid to use? I'm looking for a flavor that is fairly similar or at least somewhat close.


Here's the recipe I'm looking to make [courtesy of Alton Brown](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/fish-taco-recipe/index.html)


**Ingredients**


* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 cup packed cilantro leaves
* 2 limes, zested
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1/4 cup tequila
* 1 pound tilapia fillets
* 1 tablespoon olive oil


**Directions**


Put the garlic, cilantro, lime zest, cumin, salt, and pepper in a small food processor bowl and pulse until combined, approximately 20 seconds. With the processor running, add the tequila. Put the tilapia fillets into a 1 gallon resealable bag, add the garlic mixture and move around to coat each fillet. Set aside at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes.


Heat an electric nonstick griddle to 375 degrees F.


Brush the griddle with the olive oil. Cook the fillets until just cooked through and opaque about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Cut into strips and serve in warm tortillas with crema, shredded red cabbage and lime wedges.

The alcohol in the tequila will dissolve certain components in spices that water or oil do not. On the flavor side, tequila is basically a floral smell, so (and sniff together before you say no) why not try rose essence and honey with maybe a tiny bit of some cinnamon. You can find cooking rose water in ethnic food stores. It is used in Persian and Indian cooking.

2,My chocolate-chip cookie expanded after baking,"I have been making the same chocolate-chip cookies for a while. 
Last week, after baking a batch and removing from the oven, they expanded and became flat. 


Usually they stay in the same shape when removed from the oven, (thick and chewy) this time is the only time my cookies really expanded and became flat. 


I bake them from the freezer. 


What could have gone wrong? too much or too little baking soda? I usually put 1 tsp of baking soda per 3 1/2 cups of regular white flour. 


",<cookies>,2014-10-19 13:02:09.900,49210,3,"There are many reasons why this can be happening, cookies will spread more if the oven is not at the right temperature, try preheating for 20 minutes before you put cookies in the oven. Our ovens sometimes change through time and it might not be hot enough. Another thing could be that you added more sugar than before, sugar tends to make the cookies also spread if you add more that you were supposed too. Another one could be, since air will cause cookies to spread, you don't want to whip too much air into the cookie dough when you're creaming the butter and sugar together. Only cream for as long as it takes to combine the butter and sugar, which might only be 30 seconds or so. Beyond that and you're just incorporating too much air. SO check on this things and maybe something here rings a bell, this has happened to me when I have substituted margarine for butter, and sometimes yeah I tend to cream a bit long cause I get distracted. So yup check on this things :)

0,Low fat marinades that still work,"I´m a huge fan of good meat marinades. However, marinades usually include a lot of oil and adding it to a high fat meat, e.g. lamb or pork is adding more calories in my food than I care for.

Personally, I often use a ginger-garlic-soy sauce marinade with some alcohol added to give pork an amazing taste. Be careful with the soy sauce, tho. It contains a lot of salt.

7,Why are there caraway seeds in rye bread?,"I love rye bread, so something I have always wondered about is why there are caraway seeds in it. It seems to be some kind of tradition.


",<bread><seeds><rye>,2016-04-06 16:35:34.230,68073,10,"[Caraway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caraway) seeds in rye bread is - in some parts of the world - a tradition.


Generally speaking, certain flavour profiles are traditional in different cuisines, not ubiquitous (see your baguette counter example), for many types of food. For rye bread, taking European areas into account where there is a ""rye bread tradition"", Northern Europe (Scandinavia, Northern Germany) uses caraway, Central Europe is undecided and Southern Tyrol (the German-speaking parts of Italy) would use [blue fenugreek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonella_caerulea) instead, other regional cuisines leave their rye breads plain.


The reason why particularly rye breads tend to be ""spiced"" - as opposed to wheat-dominant breads - is that rye breads can be harder to digest and needs a sourdough step to be baked into proper bread. And seeds like caraway, [fennel seeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fennel) or the blue fenugreek mentioned above have traditionally been used to aid digestion. 


If you are buying rye bread in other parts of the world, especially the US, the predominant group of immigrants from Europe may as well have brought their specific ""rye bread flavour profile"" with them.

4,What is Vegetable Meat?,"I have come across this food, but I am not sure what it is called. This is a totally vegetarian food but looks like non vegetarian. It is made up of [soya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean)(soya beans). Does any one knows whats its real name and whether such food exists or not? Also, how organic/non artificial free from chemical is it? How **Hygienic** is it? What are the famous restaurants in the world for it? I have heard some Chinese restaurants which offers vegetarian Chinese food, is that the same? 


",<meat><vegetarian><chinese-cuisine><soy>,2012-04-16 16:05:20.560,23081,5,"I have never heard of Tofu being called ""vegetable meat"". There are some fake meat types based on different types of soya products (or also other plant proteins), like ""fake duck"". But the only product I have seen bearing the generic label ""vegetable meat"" is [textured vegetable protein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textured_vegetable_protein). It is made from soya beans whose fat has been extracted to be used for oil production. 


As for ""non artificial"", I have no idea what your personal definition of ""artificial"" is. It doesn't grow on trees, but then neither does butter, and I have never heard people condemn butter as ""artificial"". It is a processed product, and it is not a traditional process, but I can't tell you if it is more or less processed than traditional heavily processed foods such as sugar. Also, the amount of chemicals involved is probably dependent on the manufacturer. I guess you have to trust the regulatory organs of your country to not allow the production of food containing something harmful. Organic? This depends on the manufacturer too. If he adhers to organic production guidelines, then it is organic. And hygienic? This is even harder to answer, it depends on not only the manufacturer's decisions about the process, but also on the day-to-day process quality measures his employees take. 


There is no reason to say that ""vegetarian meat"" is the same as vegetarian Chinese food. A cup of rice served in a Chinese restaurant is vegetarian and Chinese, but does not include any kind of meat substitute. If I cook a French recipe and use textured soy protein as meat replacement, this makes it vegetarian, but not Chinese. There can be some overlap between the two, but I doubt that it is big. China has had social conditions leading to vegetarian lifestyles (poverty, religious restrictions) for long before production of such protein began. 


I doubt that any restaurants in the world are famous for it, mainly because it is a poor meat analogue. Yes, it offers a high amount of protein. But it does not taste really like meat. World-famous restaurants are world-famous because they offer high-quality food, and no food using inferior substitutions is high-quality. Yes, there are good vegetarian restaurants, but they don't make poor imitations of meat dishes using fake meats, they offer vegetarian dishes made from good ingredients. Some of them can feature some of the more popular soy products like tofu, but they are probably not famous for their tofu, because the tofu is not the main star of all dishes. 


This all assumes that what you refer to is actually the textured vegetable protein I linked, but that is far from clear from your question. Other possibilities exist, because people have long tried to find a suitable meat substitute for vegetarians and for people who can't afford real meat. Most are soy-based, like the mentioned tofu and tempeh, but there are also wheat-based ones like seitan, and I think that there was some kind of beans product used sometimes instead of meat. Without you giving us more information, we can't conclude for sure which one you mean. But the answers to the other questions is about the same, with the exception that some processing methods are older than others and so can be considered more traditional (in case this plays a role for your understanding of ""artificial"").

7,What's the best way to store unused sushi rice?,"Let's say, I only want to make 1 sushi roll right now. Is there a good way to store the rest of the rice for tomorrow's rolls? And what about storing the nori?

But once the vinegar and sugar is added to make sushi rice -- I wouldn't try saving it for sushi -- it's not going to have the same consistency the next day, and I really don't think it would work. You'd be better off making a vegetable roll or two with the leftovers and chilling that for the next day.


Off hand, I'm not sure where I might re-use leftover sushi rice where the consistency wasn't an issue ... maybe a rice-based casserole?


As for the nori -- I use a zip-top bag, and compress the air out, and haven't had any problems.

20,Why is DIY yogurt not as stable as sourdough starter?,"I have a sourdough starter which is now close to 15 years old. It has survived everything - including long pauses where it stood in the fridge for over a month or longer. It is incredibly stable and very hard to kill (at least I was not successful so far). Presumably you can also make a backup by drying it completely and storing it long-term (I have made such a backup, but have not had to use it yet).


Sometimes I also like to make yogurt by sterilizing milk at 90-95°C, then cooling to 45°C, adding existing yogurt, and keeping it at 45°C for about 6 hours.


This always works very well for the first 3-4 generations (starting with storebought natural joghurt). The first generations are extremely nice, just like the original.


But after some generations, it inevitably does not continue to work as well. The next generation will not become as thick, and will be more of a soup; clumps of yogurt mixed with the clear watery substance you get in these processes (sorry, don't know the word in English - is that whey?). I'm quite careful to keep the whole process as identical as possible.


Do you know the reason for that, or if it is possible to get a long-term, stable yogurt running?

That way you can develop a yogurt starter that is as viable as your sourdough starter.

14,What counters astringency?,"I've been attempting to make green smoothies lately as part of a health kick. The way I've been doing it is to use a normal smoothie recipe, but to add handfuls of spinach. 


In general, the results haven't been bad, and certainly better than I expected, but I do find the spinach to add a bit of undesired astringency the smoothie.


Now I know that certain tastes can counteract the perceived effect of other tastes. For example, sweetness can counter sourness, or salt can counter bitterness. 


I tried experimenting a bit with adding (separately) honey, lemon, and salt, but none of these seemed to make a difference in the astringent feeling the smoothie left in the mouth. What taste, if any, can counter astringency?


",<flavor>,2012-08-27 11:28:23.660,25876,12,"Many leafy and dark green vegetables have high tannic and dicarboxylic (including oxalic) acid levels. Though these are weak acids, they have a powerful astringent effect. Some of the main tricks to hiding and/or removing these are soaking in:


* Ascorbic acid (vitamin C, lemon juice)
* Fats
* Food grade lime
* Milk


So if your smoothy is milk based you will be extracting the maximum tannin from the spinach :-)


A pre-soak in a small quantity of milk and then discarding that milk, or a pre-soak in lemon juice and then a quick fresh water rinse are probably the simplest ""fixes"" of the spinach's astringent effect

4,Kitchen aid pasta roller getting oil on my pasta,"I have to avoid letting the pasta get wide enough to touch one of the sides of the roller because if it does, the grease inside gets on the edge of the pasta. The other side doesn't do it at all. I've tried feeding pasta through a bunch to see if it could just pick it all up and eventually stop, but it doesn't. I started to take it apart but I wasn't able to remove the dial, and without that I can't get the plate off on that side.


It would be nice to be able to roll out the pasta to the point where the edge makes it all square. No big deal I guess, but it does make it tough to deal with anything but minimal amounts of dough at a time.


Any ideas for getting it to stop?


",<equipment><pasta>,2011-02-14 18:22:46.613,12159,5,"I've almost never seen a pasta roller that *doesn't* do this at least a little. My 30-year-old hand-cranked one does it, same as my Kitchen Aid. I have always figured it was a side-effect of the plain bearings (essentially one piece of lubricated metal rubbing flat against another), which eventually blackens any oil intended to lubricate them.


I've been left trying to avoid the pasta reaching the edge as this is when it happens (as you've seen). When it does get discolored, my solution has always been to just trim off or discard the edge wherever it gets the black stuff on it.


I don't think you should be using the edge of the pasta roller to square up your dough in any case. If you want to make it more square, run the dough ball through, then fold the resulting sheet in thirds or whatever will make it narrow enough to feed through perpendicular to your first feeding and then run it through again. If you fold it carefully and feed it squarely, your edges will be quite square to each other. I think there may even be an illustration of this in the instructions for the Kitchen Aid pasta roller. It takes practice but it works well.

15,How do I melt the chocolate in a s'more?,"It is an age old question.


How can I ensure that the chocolate in a s'more is properly melted. Even when assembling them quickly the marshmallow just doesn't have enough heat to melt the chunk of chocolate.


Any solutions are welcome but I would especially like to know how to do it with no special tools- just a campfire and a stick.


",<chocolate><dessert><camping><fire><marshmallow>,2012-07-09 16:02:59.963,24932,16,"Since you specified not wanting any equipment other than a campfire and a stick, the best I can do is add one more piece of equipment you should be able to find anywhere (i.e., not have to carry with you): a rock.


If you put a flat-topped rock just to the edge of your campfire, you should be able to place a graham cracker and slab of chocolate on top of it. While you are toasting your marshmallow on the stick, the chocolate should start to melt. This technique won't produce totally melted chocolate (unless you have a very large, very hot fire), but the chocolate should get a little melty without being so runny that none of it makes it into your mouth.


This only works if you have thin Hershey bars or other chocolate in relatively thin pieces. Thick slabs won't soften all the way through with this type of indirect heat.


And for those people concerned about dirt, bring some aluminum foil to act as a buffer between the rock/dirty stuff and your s'more.


**Extraneous but related note:**


Your question got me thinking about ways to achieve melted chocolate with *microwave* s'mores (a last resort if I'm stuck inside with an electric oven or no oven at all), and I have an idea I'll test out tonight. When I microwave s'mores, I usually microwave the bottom graham cracker, chocolate and marshmallow together, then top with the other graham cracker once the marshmallow gets gooey. The chocolate doesn't really get melted that way, though, because marshmallows take almost no time at all to melt. I'm wondering if pushing the chocolate *inside* the marshmallow before I stick it in the microwave might help the chocolate melt more. I will update once I've had a chance to try this.


**Edit:** 
I didn't really notice any difference between microwaving the chocolate *inside* the marshmallow v. underneath the marshmallow.

-4,Can one always cook food faster in a pan with water in it with the lid on and/or high heat?,"In other words: 


* Does water boil faster with the lid ***on***? [Yes](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/32142/does-water-boil-faster-with-the-lid-on).
* But folks often don't consider food looks cooked 'till it's browned, and will find that takes a really long time to look cooked if they don't take the lid ***off***.


How can these both be true?


",<boiling>,2016-05-02 23:48:26.570,68745,-2,"Whether the lid will speed or slow the cooking, depends on the situation. High heat will only sometimes speed the cooking!


The crucial knowledge to understand and apply is that [boiling water doesn't get any hotter than 100˚C. Because of this, high heat won't cook already-boiling-hot food faster](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/30871/if-the-recipe-says-simmer-beans-for-3-hours-can-i-just-turn-up-the-heat-and-coo)! 


Typically, the fastest way to cook something is to start cooking it with the lid on, but finish it with the lid off. Why? 


* At first the food is cold. It will take a while for heat from the pan to travel into the food. We speed this up by putting on a lid, and using high heat, so that all the food surfaces not touching the pan will soon be in contact with hot air or steam, which will help quickly transport heat energy from the surface of the pan to the food. Any liquid in the pan can't pass 100˚C since it cannot exist as a liquid and be any hotter\*\*.
* Once the food reaches 100˚C, what we do next depends on if we want to brown the food, and how much water the food is in.
* If we want to brown the food, the pan has to get well above 100˚C, and any liquid water remaining the pan would prevent that.


	1. So if there is a **little** liquid, we take the lid off, so it can quickly boil off: soon there's no more liquid water in the pan, and additional heat travels directly into the food from the pan, raising its temperature enough to let it brown.
	2. If there's a **lot** of liquid, a high boil isn't going to change the temperature of the liquid, or the food in contact with the liquid, significantly\*\*. So you might as well use a low simmer\*\*\* and put he lid on to save energy. The lid won't change the cooking speed significantly though.

SE (Stack Exchange) [encourages folks to answer their own question – share their knowledge, Q&A-style](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/) and I was particularly motivated to do so because the reality is that *things do NOT cook significantly faster at a rolling boil*, and it addresses a pet peeve of mine: folks who leave food at a rolling boil, uncovered, for a long time. The rolling will stir food, which would tend to *very slightly* increase cooking speed, and the stirring could keep pasta from sticking, for example, but generally, it's wasteful.


\*\*except in extraordinary situations - like in a pressure cooker or minor exceptions, like the slightly different temperatures very salted or super-critical water boil at or other abnormal pressure situations. Since cold water sinks, any water below 100˚C will sink to the bottom of the pan where it will heat up.


\*\*\*Note: by simmer, I mean *keep at the boiling point*, in other words, at a very low boil. I think that's a meaning most people consider reasonable. [However, there's no unanimity on the meaning of simmer! Some folks define it as a temperature in a range significantly below the boiling point](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/19160/what-does-bring-to-a-simmer-mean)

",<baking><substitutions>,2018-11-03 10:00:24.223,93542,1,"The difference between bread flour and all purpose flour is that bread flour has a higher protein content. While bread flour has 12 to 14 percent protein, all purpose has 8 to 11 percent protein. The reality is that you probably won't notice the difference without a side by side comparison, so, if all you have is all purpose, just use that. If you want to increase the protein level of your flour, you can do that by adding vital wheat gluten. However, I am guessing that if you don't have access to bread flour, you will probably not have access to vital wheat gluten. In the event that you do, I found the following conversion: Measure out 1 cup all-purpose flour (4 1/2 ounces or 129 grams). Remove 1 1/2 teaspoons (1/8 ounce or 4 grams). Add 1 1/2 teaspoons vital wheat gluten (1/8 ounce or 5 grams). Whisk or sift to combine.

3,Brownie with chocolate mousse on top,"I want to make a cake that involves a brownie layer with chocolate mousse on top. I just want to use my own trusted brownie and chocolate mousse recipes. I've looked it up and found a few similar [recipes](https://www.lifeloveandsugar.com/2017/10/16/baileys-chocolate-mousse-brownie-cake/).


Now, I'm worried that the chocolate mousse might have a bit of fluids at the bottom that will ruin the brownie layer. Is there anything I can do to improve this (I was thinking of a small layer of chocolate that will prevent absorption of the fluids by the brownie) and is it generally a good idea to combine the two or am I better off making a regular chocolate cake layer instead of a brownie?


Thank you for your advice

It is opinion based whether I think a brownie or a sponge would be better with mousse, what I will say is that the consideration is the difference in consistency between the two. A rich, soft mousse on top of soft, fluffy cake may more people than hitting a thick, harder layer of brownie, but it all depends on the effect you are looking for.

6,Are English scones savoury?,"I know that scones are often seen as an unhealthy snack, but many English recipes don't actually include that much sugar and English scones contain much less sugar than American scones (why do Americans put sugar in everything?), so it got me wondering whether English scones were classed as savoury or sweet. They are often seen as sweet, but don't usually taste as sweet and are usually served with clotted cream and jam to make them sweeter.


**Are plain English scones savoury, or are they sweet due to their sugar content?**


",<scones><sweet><savoury>,2020-02-03 16:49:13.463,105129,13,"They are ***both*** sweet and savoury.


You can use the same recipe & put clotted cream & jam on them, or butter [salted, of course], or slices of cheese, ham, anything you like… even Marmite. 


This is what you get searching the BBC [good old Auntie Beeb, can't get more stiff-upper-lip British ;) - [BBC Good Food - Savoury scone recipes](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/collection/savoury-scone) Because I specifically searched 'savoury' these tend to not include sugar - but there's no reason at all that they can't.


There's a particular tang to those foods which fall perfectly between the two stools… pancakes & crêpes are the obvious ones. There are British biscuits [cookies] that embody this sweet/salt dichotomy, even though they are in themselves considered 'sweet'. I'm thinking of the traditional Scottish shortbread & the modern pretender, the Hob Nob. Heck, over here we even put cheese on xmas cake ;)  

This sweet/salt is not the same as sweet & sour, but a similar effect, I guess.

8,Is it possible to make caramel that does not taste sweet?,"Since sugar turns into caramel when heated, caramel is not sugar. I suppose then, that caramel still tastes sweet because of the uncaramelized sugar mixed in the caramel.

",<sugar><caramel>,2016-04-12 17:08:40.870,68234,11,"It is very simple, you just have to heat it long enough. It can even happen by accident :)

Also, your assumption ""because of the uncaramelized sugar mixed in the caramel"" is incorrect, or at least incomplete. There usually is such sugar, but many of the caramelization products of the early stages of caramelization also taste sweet on their own. In later stages, you get more and more nonsweet stuff until you get into the state I described (barely liquid charcoal).

The seeds have a very different flavor from the leaves.


As for dried cilantro, the leaves? They're going to be pretty much flavorless compared to fresh cilantro. Cilantro loses its aroma quickly when heated or dried. Obviously there's still something left, or you wouldn't be able to buy dried cilantro, but it's not going to be a striking addition to a dish. If you can get it fresh, it's worth it.

4,Can I cook beans without salt?,"I made some refried beans in a slow cooker, loosely following the recipe from my cookbook. The recipe says to cook the beans with ½ teaspoon of salt. Is this necessary to properly cook the beans? I am starting from dry beans.


I actually used ½ tbsp of soy sauce instead of plain salt and the beans tasted fine, but I would rather add no salt or soy sauce.


I see from [this question](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/20754/does-adding-salt-when-soaking-dry-beans-toughen-or-soften-the-skin-of-the-bean) that salt can affect the softness of the beans, but it seems like the beans should soften eventually either way. Since I am making refried beans, I only need the beans to soften enough for me to break them apart with a hand mixer, and then I can continue cooking them until they’re ready.


[This post](http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/15/when-to-salt-your-beans/) at the New York Times only discusses using salt to add flavor to the beans, but I am not worried about that. If I make a salt-free batch of beans and don’t like the taste, I can always go back to adding salt next time.


So will the beans cook properly in a slow cooker without adding salt?


",<salt><slow-cooking><beans>,2015-05-16 22:37:14.173,57551,2,"Yes. In fact, many, many people believe (falsely) that adding salt before or during cooking will keep beans hard (a myth addressed in your first link), and most of these people have been cooking perfectly good beans for many years without adding salt until the beans were fully cooked.


The cooking time may vary slightly. In some circumstances, the texture of the beans and/or their skins may soften at somewhat different rates than with salt. But the beans will still cook fine.


(One note: some chefs have claimed that cooking beans without salt causes people to add even more salt afterward to create a flavor that tastes ""properly salted."" Beans are generally enhanced by adding flavoring components early enough in cooking for the flavors to penetrate. But you can always add salt afterward too; the resulting flavor distribution will just be different.)

5,Gyuto knife - What it can & can't cut? What cutting techniques?,"I bought a Gyuto knife but now I am unsure what I can cut with it. The manufacturer says I shouldn't try to cut bones or frozen things with it, which seems clear to me.


But how about raw potatoes & sweet potatoes? They also can be pretty hard. And what about an avocado or mango where cut along the stone in the center of the fruit? Is a Gyuto the right tool for that?


Also, is it ok to firmly press garlic on the cutting bord with the side of the knife?


And what about the technique? I know how to use a Santoku or Gyuto with the ""cutting motion"", but what about chopping? Actually I thought all japanese knifes are made for chopping, but I heard someone that the blade can break.


Info about the knife: The center of the knife consists of VG-10 steel, coated with a chrome alloy. The blade is 24 cm long, HR is 60.


",<equipment><knives><cutting>,2012-12-01 12:24:11.550,28796,11,"You can do anything with this knife that you would do with your santoku or Western-style chef's knife. These are real tools, and they are not especially delicate. It is certainly possible to chip the edge or tip (which requires an annoying amount of work to fix), if you drop the knife or, as the manufacturer warns, whack it against bones. This is a consequence of the relatively high hardness of your blade -- not of the fact that it's a gyuto -- but the flip side is that it should retain its edge very nicely for normal work. (A softer steel would end up with a rolled edge or dent rather than a chip.)


I guess that by ""chopping"" you mean quickly lifting and pushing the blade down through food so that it hits the cutting board. That's perfectly normal usage, and a plastic, wood, or rubber cutting board should not hurt your knife at all. (*No glass!* Do run it over a steel it often as you use it, though.) The foods you mentioned -- potatoes and fruit pits -- may seem hard, but they are *much* softer than the edge of your knife.

Much depends on what you are layering or assembling the cake with, as well as what the layers are made of.


For example, if you have a pastry cream or whipped cream layer, these really only last a few hours.

Cakes also freeze exceedingly well, especially prior to being iced.


What you may choose to do is bake your layers or base cake at your convenience, let them cool, then wrap them well, and freeze.


Then, as reasonably close to service as is convenient, thaw the layers and ice, and optionally decorate as appropriate.


You can also freeze iced cakes, although it is a little trickier.

1,Do quiet induction burners exist?,"I've owned and used a variety of counter top induction burners, ranging from 1200-1800 watts, including popular, well reviewed brands.


Between the electronic whines and the fans, they were all extremely loud; amongst the loudest items in my home kitchen, and annoying enough that I don't use induction as much as I'd prefer to.


Do any quiet induction burners actually exist?


",<equipment><induction>,2020-07-17 01:44:10.677,109792,3,"Quieter, yes. Quiet, no.


This was based on my recent research where I tested out 8 different portable induction burners, did a lot of reading, and ultimately decided not to buy one.


Induction burners [make noise](https://inductionpros.com/induction-cooktop-noise-level/) for two main reasons:


1. They work via a spinning electromagnetic field, which causes both the burner and the vessel to vibrate microscopically, creating a loud hum.
2. They have an internal fan to keep the electronics cool while the burner is on. This is often the louder source of noise.


Higher-end induction burners produce less noise by having a heavier case (reducing vibration), and by having a better cooling fan. However, having tried some of these fairly expensive [commercial burners](https://www.magneticcooky.com/commercial-double-induction-cooktop-comparison/), like a Waring and a Vollrath, I'd say they are quieter but not exactly something you'd use in a room with a sleeping baby.


Built-in burners can reduce noise further simply by having sound insulation built into the cooktop, and many do.

65,Is there a problem with defrosting meat on the counter?,"I generally defrost meat on the kitchen counter. A friend of mine suggested that this was dangerous and suggested that I defrost meat in the refrigerator. I am no biologist but it seems to me that as long as the meat doesn't get warm defrosting it on the counter should be safe.


Generally, I remove the frozen items from the freezer and place them on a plate on the counter in the packaging they were frozen in. When they are mostly / completely thawed I place the meat in the refrigerator.

However, defrosting in the refrigerator can take a long time and require you to plan at least one day ahead of time. I'm not so good at this, which leads to a safe and fast solution: Defrost meat in a waterproof ziploc bag in cold water. Change the water every 30 minutes until defrosted.

0,"What does ""heat the oven to broil"" mean?","[This recipe](https://www.chowhound.com/recipes/miso-ginger-glazed-salmon-29538) states:



> 
> Heat the oven to broil and arrange a rack in the middle.
>

Then later:



> 
> Broil the salmon on the baking sheet ... about 10 to 12 minutes.

I don't understand what this means. What does ""heat the oven to broil"" mean? It definitely seems to be talking about putting it in the oven, since it also says ""arrange a rack in the middle"". And then it goes on to say ""broil the salmon"".


But if it calls for broiled salmon, why wouldn't I just put it in the broiler (broiler is underneath my oven)?


My oven goes up to 500F, I don't know what temperature ""broil"" means or how to heat the oven to that temperature, and I'm also confused because how can you ""broil"" something on the middle rack of an oven, especially a conventional oven, and with only a heating element on the bottom instead of the top?


I can't make sense of what this recipe is calling for if it's not putting the salmon in the actual broiler.


",<language><broiling>,2017-02-21 22:59:55.740,78618,7,"In general, there are [two types of ovens](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/48936/broiler-drawer-vs-oven-broiler):


1. Ovens with a broiler drawer under their oven.
2. Ovens with a second top heating element (broiler) in the main oven compartment.


Your oven is the former; mine (and apparently the author's) is the latter.


So, in this case, the instructions mean ""heat the oven to the broil setting"".


Since you have the first type of oven, your only option will be to put your oven in broiler mode and hope the distance between the broiler and the fish is sufficient. With the recipe calling for the fish to be on the middle rack, it sounds like it's pretty far from the heat source, so you'll probably need to keep a close eye on your fish as I'm guessing your setup will be much closer. It's even possible that it won't work at all.

4,How can I make a homemade latte taste like a restaurant one?,"At the moment I prepare lattes at home as follows:


* 1/3 cup water + 1T ground coffee in Krups espresso machine (looks a bit like [this one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krups))
* 2/3 cup microwave-heated milk (the milk steamer on the machine doesn't work)
* 5 drops honey


It tastes nice, but not like a restaurant latte, and not just because there's no foam. What is needed to make coffee taste as good as restaurant coffee? This machine doesn't work properly so I'm prepared to buy some new equipment but obviously on a home budget not a restaurant one.


* Machine: better to get one that grinds beans?
* Ratio of ingredients: does it need to change?
* Coffee form: beans / ground coffee?
* Coffee strength: experimentation has settled on strong and milky, I don't think this needs to change
* Milk: does it have to be steamed? do you get hand steamers?
* Fat content of milk: fat free / 2% / full cream?
* Container: surely not, restaurant stuff tastes better even in a takeaway paper cup! :)
* Other variables?


",<coffee>,2011-07-13 06:40:45.497,17771,4,"`To answer your question with a straightforward solution, my key recommendation would be to buy a new machine for two reasons: better espresso and milk.`


Before all, if you are not willing to invest more than $100 (USD) in a machine (more like $350, but I'm sure you can scrounge for a decent entry-level machine to get the job done), you can stop reading as my suggestion relies on a better machine. That said, quickly browsing Amazon [I found a Cuisinart unit with tepid reviews (205 averaging 3.5 stars) on sale for about $80.](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000MX3HOQ)


Here is what is going wrong with your latte:


* **Machine**: If you have a Krups it's pressure probably isn't rated. This is a bad sign as it indicates how well it will ""pull"" (brew, make) the espresso. My guess for most units: Unrated = *won't* pull. Buy a machine with a rated pressure, 15-bar is what to expect. (I don't mean to sound snobby; I got by with a $60 Coffeemate for awhile, but they won't get you the results you're asking for)
* **Bean**: Lattes are made with espresso, not coffee (U.S.). You're using coffee. So start by buying espresso beans instead of dark roast coffee or Folgers. While you're at it, if you want it to taste like restaurant quality, buy them from a local roaster (I'd imagine you can get some mad fresh beans in Africa) and grind them fresh (just prior to brewing). I prefer a coarser grind to my espresso, you will also need to press the grinds (""pack"") in the gruppa (metal basket of machine).
* **Milk**: While you're at it, don't necessarily use whatever comes out of the fridge. [Here](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/16286/15) and [here](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/13273/15) have the dirt on milk and frothing. Basically [fuller body for the drink use milk with more fat, if not use less fat](http://www.coffeegeek.com/guides/frothingguide/milk). If you have a favorite place in mind for your exemplar latte, go ask them where they get their milk and follow suit. There's a degree of preference in *which* milk you use, go with the one you know you prefer and perfect your technique.
* **Frothing/Steaming**: You aren't frothing your milk. Buy a machine with a working wand, froth the milk. Actually, frothing the milk is fun and it tastes great all on its own. Note: you *do* want to get foam on top, this indicates you have properly steamed the milk below (remember to hold back the foam, and pour only the steamed milk into your latte, then depending on your region's definition adding a bit of foam on top).
* **Container**: Add some dignity to life whenever you can. Use ceramic; you're at home.


Those are the key differences that are causing problems for the latte you want to amp up. Now you can skip the consumer espresso machine advice and get a stove-top setup ([espresso pot](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0000CF3Q6) and use a normal, smallish pot with a whisk for the milk), but that takes a smidge more effort in terms of getting it right. Either way, following these guidelines should get that latte much closer to where you want it to be. Basically, the only advantage the shop will have over yours is a bigger machine, overworked employees who might not have the time to care about your coffee at this time, and paper cups.

1,How can I store wonton wrappers in the freezer?,"I have found that authentic frozen egg roll wrappers from an Asian food store work well for canneloni and ravioli. Just thaw, fill, and roll.

But I don't always have these on hand and the nearest place I can get them is about 30 miles away. I have tried buying extra and keeping them frozen but they seem to get freezer burned quickly, with the edges being too dry and brittle to use.

They made them all up and placed them on cookie sheets to freeze and then placed them in ZipLock bags and they had a nice supply to pull out of the freezer whenever they were ready to cook them.

10,"Can the bacon in homemade ""Bacon Salt"" be made shelf stable?","After success making several fancy salts including Sriracha, smoked, and green chili I've decided to try to move in to stranger and tastier territories. As such I want to make a bacon salt. The commercial products don't use real bacon (or at least the ones I've seen) and all the do-it-yourself recipes claim it not to be shelf stable.


My hope was that cooking the bacon crisp would remove a majority of the moisture, preserving something akin to jerky. Once cooked it would be pulverized and adding have a large amount of kosher salt added to it, many times that than the weight of bacon used. I would hope that these preservation techniques being used two-fold would help make said meat candy shelf-stable. 


However I worry that there is risk of some of the greases in the pulverized bacon going rancid. Is there anything I can do short of keeping it in the fridge or heat preserving the entire concoction, or is my plan likely to work?

There are a very few uses (such as yeast raised dough) where you want to be more precise. I would not use salted butter for a yeast dough by preference, but if I had to, I would calculate the amount of salt to remove from the other ingredients based on this ratio:

I propose **sourdough starter** as an additive that should almost double the life of your bread. Unlike the fatty *enriching agents* you suggest, using a sourdough starter should minimally impact the type of loaf you are baking. The process for making sourdough bread is quite similar to the ""no-knead"" method you are familiar with, and the result is similar, albeit with a more complex flavor. The downside, of course, is the work involved in maintaining a starter.


With respect to using a plastic bag, I usually split the difference: I store the bread uncovered for the first day to enjoy the crunch of the crust, and move it to plastic after to keep it moist. Do make sure the bread is completely cool before putting it in plastic.


I would also encourage you to embrace stale bread as a wonderful ingredient. When I bake, I count on a portion of the bread going stale, and use it for toast, croutons, french toast, stuffing, panzanella, or bread pudding.

Not more than any other kind of similar cooking by radiant heat, like baking. There is simply no mechanism by which that could happen. Let's examine some claims I found from Google:


*from <http://www.greenbuild.org/uncategorized/3-reasons-solar-cooking-is-good-for-you-and-the-environment/>*



> 
> Solar cooking doesn’t use smoke that can contain carcinogens or microwaves that expose your food to potentially dangerous radio waves.
> 
> 
> 


An electric stove produces no smoke (if you don't burn the food), and natural gas produces very little smoke. Were there smoke emitted by the stove, the area around it would be covered in soot, and the flame would be yellow from the carbon (the main component of soot and smoke) heated to incandescence in the flame. Further, the biggest cancer risk from smoked foods is not the smoke, but the [nitrates](http://nchfp.uga.edu/how/cure_smoke/nitrates_nitrites.html) frequently used to cure them.


If microwaves emit dangerous radio waves, the sun emits far more. That's why it's so bright, and so hot. I suppose you could be harmed by the microwave's radio waves if you manage to turn it on without shutting the door. Then again, you can cook your hand in a solar cooker, too. Or a stove. Come to think of it, cooking involves potentially dangerous heat. Huh.


Also: [Does microwaving destroy nutrients in food?](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/5343/25930) (summary: no more than any other cooking)



> 
> Plus, when you cook in a solar appliance, the nutrients stay in the food and don’t leach out. That’s because you don’t use water in solar cooking. And, the temperatures in a solar oven are moderate – around 325 F – so nutrients aren’t destroyed during cooking at a high temperature like on a grill or over an open flame.
> 
> 
> 


This is also true of many other methods of preparing foods: baking, grilling, microwaving, frying and, don't involve water. 325 F is not an unusual temperature for baking, and most other methods can be performed gently, if desired.




---


To summarize: there may be benefits of solar cooking (a big one: it requires no fuel), but nutrition is not one of them. There's no way sunlight can add more nutrition to food that wasn't there to begin. Any nutritional benefits are not as much from solar cooking specifically as they are from not cooking by some less nutritional method. For example, any cooking method that is *not boiling* will not have the possibility of dissolving some of the food's nutrition.

If the salmon needed refrigeration for safety... the danger zone is temperatures above 40F/4-5C. Even in a warm house, refrigerators generally are insulated well enough to keep a safe temperature for up to ~4 hours. (Really old refrigerators, or ones with a damaged seal around the door may not do as well.) So if the room cooled down fast enough, the refrigerator would never have gotten into the danger zone. On the other hand, if it stayed at 10-20C for most of a day, the fridge may have gotten too warm for a while. You can try to guess at this based on your knowledge of your house and the weather, but it's hard to say from here. If you think the salmon spent several hours over 5C, and it needed refrigeration for safety, it's no longer safe. If not, it's fine. Take your best guess, and when in doubt throw it out.

If you're having trouble finding some, you could look for panko style bread crumbs. [This is the brand](http://www.kikkomanusa.com/homecooks/products/products_hc_details.php?pf=10518) that's available around here, but your mileage may vary. It's a larger Asian style breadcrumb made without the crusts. It gives it a lighter texture. I suspect that is a lot closer to what he's using in the video.

9,What is the lowest possible temperature for stewing meat?,"If you want to stew meat low and slow, how low can you go and still get collagen break-down?


And would there be any advantage to stewing at the lowest possible temperature?


",<meat><stews>,2012-06-29 07:17:06.713,30285,12,"As far as I know, Collagen starts to break down below 60°C/140F, time play a big role, i.e. to get the same breakdown at 60°C as 80°C you might need 24-48h instead of 3-4h.


The higher the heat the more the meat is contracted and it will get dryer, in a stew that might not be as obvious as in other cooking methods but it should still be the fact. Compare tough cuts of meat cooked sous vide at 55°C-60°C for 24-100h, they get very tender and moist.


So the benefit will be moister meat. I think you must cook the veggies at much higher temperature (80°C-95°C) so you would have to separate the two. If the end result is worth the effort I do not know, I have wanted to try doing a 'stew' with meat cooked sous vide at 55°C - 60°C for 24h+, with the veggies done on the side at 80°C-95°C, normal stew style, to see if it would be better, but I have never tried.


**Sources**


Hum, I'm sure you or anyone can find enough sources to argue that you need 70-80°C(160-180°F), see e.g. On food and cooking(2004) pg 163 **""*...Meats with a significant amount of tough connective tissue must be cooked to a minimum of 160-180°F/70-80°C to dissolve their collagen into gelatin*. ""**


The only potentially credible and official (what do you mean by that?) source that potentially can trump On Food and Cooking is Modernist Cuisine, I will quote.


MC 3.78-79 ***""When meat is cooked at temperatures above 50°C/122°F, a different chemical reaction -- the conversion of collagen into gelatin --* becomes prominent.""** it continues and says ***""Cookbooks and some scientific sources commonly claim that collagen converts to gelatine ""at"" some particular temperature. Usually the cited threshold lies between 60°C and 75°C / 140°F and 167°F. In reality, the hydrolysis of collagen is simply another example of a chemical reaction whose rate varies exponentially with temperature.""*** it goes on describing that the exact temperature have not been measured and that it depends on what type of collagen, e.g. breed, cut and age. Finally it says ***""Tough meats can be cooked until tender at any temperature above 55°C/130°F (and even a bit below, if you are patient enough).""***


Also see lots of sous vide recipes on the net saying that you can cook tough meat at much less temperature than 70°C/160°F and get it very tender. Or try it, I have and it works!!! I have stopped eating primary expensive cuts, flank, shin and brisket tastes much better!


See also SAJ14SAJ reply and Stefanos comment below, as per Baldwin which should be almost as good a source as oFaC and MC


**Conclusion** 


The answer to the **question**, ""*how low can you go and still get collagen break-down*"" I would answer 55°C/130°F or even a bit lower. That is NOT a realistic temperature for cooking a stew, especially not if you will put veggies in it, but as far as collagen breakdown goes that is the lowest temperature for '**stewing meat**'.

39,Why do we use so much water to cook spaghetti?,"Every time I cook spaghetti in a regular pot, I get the feeling that I could save litres of water if the pot had been created with spaghetti cooking in mind. This is especially true when I only need 1-2 portions. Cooking smaller pasta is more efficient.

Just use less water in a regular pot and feed the pasta into the boiling water. It takes about 30 seconds for long spaghetti to soften enough for it to fit into a regular pot. It cooks just fine **WITHOUT** breaking it up if you give it a quick stir after a minute, and then every couple of minutes or so


If you know your stove temperature and spaghetti type, it will only take a couple of goes to work out the least amount of water you can use. I use about 1 l of boiling water for three adult servings of spaghetti in a medium domestic pot. With the lid half on it is cooked to a firm bite point in less than 8 minutes, and the water just covers the spaghetti when finished

2,Keep macaroni cheese creamy after refrigerating,"I occasionally make Macaroni and Cheese with a béchamel/roux (and tuna, but I still call Macaroni and Cheese). I make the sauce with butter, corn flour and milk and add the cheese later. I use **a lot** of milk and after I've just cooked and served the dish the sauce has a beautiful creamy/liquid texture.


I cook the sauce in one pot and the pasta in another. When both are cooked I quickly drain the pasta and add both it and the drained canned tuna to the sauce. I then heat it just long enough to raise the temperature of the tuna without changing the flavour by recooking it.


However, when I refrigerate the leftovers and reheat them I just end up with clumps of pasta (and tuna) stuck together with an almost solid sauce. The flavour is still good, it's just the texture that's changed. Is the pasta absorbing extra moisture before it cools? How can I prevent this so I have creamy reheated Macaroni and Cheese?


",<reheating>,2015-02-16 10:18:13.783,57582,3,"Having made this dish again recently and experimenting with it based on the comments here can report the following:


A good creamy texture in the pot after the initial preparation will become a single hard lump in the fridge. Adding more milk before refrigeration will:


1. Prevent it from solidifying
2. Reheat (e.g. in a microwave) to a close enough texture to the original


The amount of milk that needs to be added is about the same quantity as went into the dish originally, i.e. if you used 1 litre in the dish before serving it (assuming only a small quantity removed) add another 1 litre of milk before refrigerating. If you served half of it, only add half a litre of milk, etc. The only downside is that the extra liquid separates slightly in the fridge, leaving watery pools on the surface of the food. This extra moisture can simply be stirred back into the dish before reheating.

Put a good rub on, wrap the racks of ribs (individually) in aluminum foil, with some beer or cola in there (or other braising liquid) and let them go. For a video of how to do this watch this episode of ""[Good Eats](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktCSk18cTss)"" All of that said, I have never tried to let the ribs go 7 hours unattended, so I would try it when you have the time to hang around and monitor the internal temp, again *looking for 160°F internal temp* and that will give you a means to determine what is ""*done*"".

0,Is it really that easy to make safe cured salmon with a 3 min sugar/salt brine?,"The reason for this question is that I live in a landlocked part of the US, thus; the salmon I have access to isn't ""fresh off the boat"", and there aren't really any places I have access to sushi grade sushi (which I would just eat raw without curing).

I'm not all that scared of parasites in the salmon, b/c the process in which the salmon is cut into strips would make it very easy to see if there are little ""worms"" in the fish. I'm more concerned with the actual bacteria that might be on the fish and whether this 3 minute brine would be sufficient.

",<baking><cookies>,2014-08-19 08:47:23.217,46507,1,"Whole wheat flour behaves very differently from all purpose flour. Sifting will help, but you will still have lots of bran and protein left. 


It's not recommended to use pure whole wheat flour for baking, except where you want the effect (as in pumpernickel, for example). You'll get cookies which will be rather tough, moist and will seem underbaked (but no amount of baking will remove the impression). Nothing crumbly about them. 


The result will be edible, but very different from a standard cookie, and it is questionable that you will like it. Still, if you are feeling adventurous, you can try it out and see if it's what you want. 


You could try to mix your whole wheat flour with pure starch, which will make the result more cookielike in texture, or also some non-wheat flours such as quinoa flour. It still won't be like a classic cookie in texture, and the taste will be unusual too.

If you keep the starter in the fridge you can get away with feeding it twice a week depending on your yeast strain. You can do this by eye…if the starter starts to look ugly when you take it out to feed, you should feed it a little more often. 


One thing I will say is that you can resurrect a starter that seems long past edible. The starter will get a cloudy fluid on top of the batter and develop a really strong smell if you let it go too long. My personal experience is that you can pour off the watery fluid and some of the batter if need be. Then add a good feeding of flour and water. It will take a little longer than usual to build up again. Yeast is a very durable critter.

So, aside from the question of how this fridge is actually responding to the scale (I suspect it is not doing much), does anyone know what to store at ""low"" humidity and what to store at ""high"" humidity?

What was on the pizzas? Shrimp? Chicken? Raw sausage? Those things have a pretty short safety window. Cured meats like pepperoni are safer longer (that's why they're cured in the first place).


How hot was your kitchen?


How long did they sit out?


And then of course it comes down also to how long and how hot you're cooking things. You might well be able to kill off germs in things that aren't outright spoiled. Pizza isn't that long-cooking, so there's risk there.


Ultimately, you have to be the arbiter of safety. Check the USDA website about food safety and follow every rule if you want to feel certain.

But to get to the heart of the matter, if it's really an adult beef heart, it's too tough and chewy to cook quickly. Braising is my preferred method and the one closest to my heart. This is one of those things can cook all day and will eventually become incredibly tender -- tasting like a slightly unusual and hearty pot roast.


You can also stuff them and then either braise or roast them -- again, ""low and slow"" heat is the most heart-friendly. If you roast it, also be sure there is enough moisture in the stuffing (i.e., leave a ""soft spot"" in your heart), or else it can dry out during a long bake. (You can also ""roast"" it in a dutch oven or something.) When you open up your heart after cooking, a dry stuffing will just leave you with a heavy heart.


A final option is to use it as stew meat. It will take longer to cook than most stew meats, so you might want to simmer for a while first before adding vegetables. Then cook until the flavors come together and your heart's content.


Once, when I had leftovers after making a stuffed heart, I was just going eat it, but then I had a change of heart. I chopped up the tender meat and added it to chili. It probably was about 1/3 of the overall meat in the chili, along with some diced chuck chunks and some ground beef. It came out incredibly good: there was a deep earthy flavor that really worked well. I served it to a number of friends without explaining the dish, and they didn't notice anything unusual; I didn't have the heart to tell them. In fact, a number of people said it was some of the best chili they had tasted, which was really heartwarming to hear.


Take heart! There are lots of ways to cook it. Any slow-cooking method or recipe you might use for a tough cut of beef will probably work -- just follow your heart.

pasta cooking is influenced by three factors: water penetration inside the pasta, **gelatinization of the starch** (it normally occurs at a temperature between **60°C and 70°C** for wheat starch) and the **denaturation and consequent coagulation of gluten (at 70°C-80°C)**.
A temperature above 80°C for a certain time (slightly longer than what you'd need at 100°C to compensate for the slower penetration of water into the pasta) should guarantee a perfectly cooked pasta. 


This is the same for dried pasta and for fresh pasta; fresh will cook in less time, and you should probably taste it during the cooking process to find the right texture. 


The rolling boil helps to keep the pasta well separated and to avoid sticking, but a water circulator would probably take care of that too

24,How do you coat perfectly round truffles with melted chocolate?,"How do you coat perfectly round truffles with melted chocolate. Preferably with the least amount of mess. Normally, I just dip the truffle into a bowl of melted chocolate and remove the truffle with a spoon. I then will place them on a sheet of wax paper.


However, this leaves my truffles looking ...well not so round. The chocolate drips down causing the truffle to have a flat surface. And the ball is not smooth.


The recipe I am following can be found [here](http://icookandcode.com/2014/07/20/recipe-mint-oreo-chocolate-truffle/) and an example is shown below:


![Example](https://i.stack.imgur.com/v7ygL.jpg)


",<chocolate-truffles>,2014-07-29 21:17:09.600,45983,35,"I don't know about *perfectly* round, but you can do better.


Stick toothpicks in the truffles before dipping. Dip them using the toothpick, let it drip enough to make sure there's not a ton of excess, probably while spinning it a bit to let it cool slightly and make sure it doesn't all accumulate in one place. Then stab the other end of the toothpick into something to hold it with the truffle at the top. (A block of foam works, as does cardboard, though you might need to pre-poke holes.) 


This avoids having a lot of excess coating chocolate, which it looks like you're getting a lot of when scooping out with a spoon. There can still be a little excess, but it'll drip down the toothpick, not get smeared all over. It also avoids having to mess up any of the surface by touching it with the spoon.


Beyond that, they'll be as perfectly round as you managed to roll the centers, which is mostly just a matter of a bit of practice and obsessiveness. So they won't be *perfectly* round, but they'll be a lot smoother and rounder, definitely enough to impress people. You do get a small hole on one side of the truffle, possibly with a tiny bit of excess chocolate around it where it collected against the toothpick, but I don't think that's terribly ugly. Plus as long as a decent fraction are pretty, you can just eat your mistakes.


Here's what a friend and I managed on our first try:


![truffles](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OyTIY.jpg)


As you can see, they're definitely not perfect. But we got better at it as we went along. A lot of the irregularities are from initial inexperience, variation in chocolate temperature (we didn't have a great water bath or hot plate setup), and simply not having terribly round centers.


Finally, you might want to practice tempering the chocolate a bit better. Having nice glossy smooth surface makes them look a lot cleaner even if they aren't perfect.

14,Navigating the different types of cookware - new kitchen advice,"I am looking to buy new cookware and I am confused by all the choices I have. I am trying to balance healthyness vs. ease of use vs. taste of prepared food vs. total cost of ownership (in that order).


My setup is 3-burner gass range, gas grill and convection oven. The cooking I do is most often stir-frying, sautéing, steaming, stewing, pan-roasting and making sauces (my wife does baking, but she is mostly happy with her gear).


So far, for the last 10 years I have been using Teflon non-stick pots and skillets and I've been fairly happy with them. My last set lasted for 6 years, but by now most of them have developed small spots of ""anti-seasoning"" (caramelized burnt stuff bound with the teflon), that cause everything to stick and give off-taste to food.


Initially, I was considering to buy high-grade Teflon cookware (Scanpan, Fissler or Swiss Diamond), but we got concerns about the Teflon becoming unstable at high temperature and contaminating the food (that is becoming important with a toddler in the house). As a side note, I am not sure how can I measure the temperature of a gas burner and the temperature of the pan, but I also believe it is all a matter of degree anyway (i.e. it is not safe at 259C and then suddenly becoming dangerous at 260C) - any informed opinions on that matter are welcome.


Next I was looking at aluminum pans with ceramic non-stick coating, but I can not find reliable sources of pros and cons - it still looks like a novelty and possibly immature technology. In particular I am concerned about its non-stickiness, cracking when heating without food in it (or deglazing), and risk of denting while cleaning. That, and the concern that if the ceramic coating is anything like the La Creuset enamel, I wouldn't exactly call it ""non-stick"".


Next I was recommended stainless-steel, which is more expensive than the other options and comes in way too many flavors - with and without core, aluminum vs. copper core, differences in thickness, etc. I am not sure what difference do these make and why are the prices varying so much (I've seen them ranging from 12,000 to 60,000 JPY).


Finally, to round it off, it would be nice if somebody is comparing all these options to include cast iron and earthenware. Any links to useful articles (not shopping reviews) would be appreciated.


",<cookware><non-stick><stainless-steel><ceramic>,2013-01-27 03:38:35.457,30453,23,"What makes a good pan?
======================


The main properties of a metal pan that are of interest to a cook are:


* *Evenness of heat distribution.* Every burner produces more heat in some spots than others. The better the pan conduct heat, the more this heat is evened out before it is conducted into the food being cooked, which is important to prevent local hotspots in the pan, and resultant burning or uneven cooking of the food. The metals that provide the best heat conduction, in descending order, are silver, copper, aluminum, and finally steel or iron.
* *Heat retention* This can be an advantage or a disadvantage. High heat retention is great for searing, as the pan will not immediately cool when food is placed into as much as a less retentive pan. Highly responsive pans, which change temperature quickly in response to changes in burner level or when taken off the heat are also desirable in other applications as it gives the cook more control.
* *Ease of maintenance and cleaning* You want a pan that is easy to clean and does not require special treatment.
* *Durability* Will the pan stand up to heavy use over many years?
* *Chemical activity* Does the interior surface of the pan interact with food chemically, changing its flavor? Active metals include aluminum and iron, especially in the presence of acid. aluminum can be rendered inactive through [anodization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anodizing) (as is used in the famous Calphalon line).
* *How much does it weigh?* Many folks find very heavy cookware exceptionally inconvenient. However, weight is also related to heat retention, and more mass of metal simply provides more material to retain heat.
* *Non-stick* Is it easy or difficult for food to stick?
* *Aesthetics* Is it pretty? Or even attractive enough to put out onto a serving table? This is a personal opinion, so I will not address it further.
* *Is it ferrous?* If you use an induction cook top, only ferrous (iron or steel) pans will interact with the magnetic field to generate heat. The ""magnet test""--does a kitchen magnet stick to the pan--will tell you if a pan is ferrous.


Metals commonly used in pots and pans
=====================================


The various metals used in pots and pans have different advantages and disadvantages under these criteria:


* *Stainless Steel*. Very durable, moderately low conductivity of heat, very maintainable (can go in the dishwasher, for example, if you choose.)
* *Carbon steel* Much rarer than stainless, except perhaps in large stock pots or woks. Inexpensive, moderately low conductivity of heat, more chemically active than stainless.
* *Iron*. Chemically active (especially with acids), low conductivity of heat, very high heat retention (due to cast iron pans having a lot of mass of metal), heavy.
* *Copper*. Best conductivity of heat of typical metals used in pans, very chemically active with foods, requires maintenance as it will tarnish.
* *Aluminum*. Second best conductivity of heat of typical metals used in pans, chemically active in some circumstances unless anodized.


Construction Methods
====================


Due to the different properties of these metals, in order to take advantage of their strengths, and mitigate their weaknesses, pans are made from one or a combination of metals. The most common are:


* *Cast iron*. Inexpensive, heavy, exceptional heat retention, requires seasoning and careful maintenance. When properly seasoned, food will not stick easily, even eggs. Can rust.
* *Enamelled cast iron*. Expensive, heavy, exceptional heat retention, easier maintenance. Must be handled with some care as crazing of the enamel can occur, which will reduce the non-stick properties of the lining, and is not attractive. Not chemically active with food due to lining.
* *Carbon steel*. Inexpensive, poor heat distribution (an advantage in woks which desire a hot spot at the centre), requires seasoning and careful maintenance. Can rust.
* *Aluminum*. Excellent conductivity, chemically active with acid foods. Not usually seen in the retail environment, but may be found in restaurant supply stores, especially for large stock pots or pasta boiling pots.
* *Anodized Aluminum*. Moderately heavy, excellent heat conductivity and retention, unique aesthetic, pricey.
* *Plain stainless steel, not layered*. Poor conductivity, excellent maintainability, moderate price.
* *Copper (lined)*. Very best conductivity, cannot go in dishwasher, very expensive, unique color (some people find copper pans very attractive). If lined with tin, as is traditional, rather than steel or some other material, must be treated with care and the lining will eventually wear and have to be redone.
* *Layered or ""sandwich"" stainless steel with an aluminum or copper disk or core*. Advantages from the steel are excellent maintainability, and from the core, very good conductivity. An excellent compromise, but can be moderately expensive.


On layered pans
===============


There are two ways the layered pans from the last bullet item are produced:


* Disk at the bottom. A disk at the bottom of the pan, which only gives good conductivity on the area the disk covers, which may not be the entire bottom.
* Entire pan is layered, up the sides. Gives better conductivity across the entire bottom of the pan, and up the sides.


This is a quality differentiator in the market. A poor pan will have a disk that doesn't cover the entire bottom, so the cooking will not be even at the edges.


A quality pan will have a disk that covers to the edge, or even entire pan construction, although for cooktop use, the most important issue is covering the entire bottom of the pan.


Finally, very large pots (stock pots, or for boiling pasta water), the layering makes very little difference, as conductivity is not the key issue--the convection of the water or stock evens out the heat. For stock pots, price is the major issue.


On Non-stick coatings (Teflon or PTFE)
======================================


[Teflon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene) (a trademark name) or PTFE (the generic name) lined pans are often available for any of the construction materials and methods outlined above. They range in levels of quality, from light cheap pans that are nearly disposable to high quality pans. 


They offer the following advantages and disadvantages, in addition to the properties inherent in the base pan construction:


* *Non-stick*. Amazing non-stick properties. PTFE is one of the lowest friction materials known to mankind at this time.
* *Care* Must be handled with care, such as not abusing them with hard metal utensils which would scratch or damage the non-stick coating.
* *Cannot be overheated* At temperatures above about 500°F (260°C), as the PTFE break down and some of the components are volatile (will vaporize) and are toxic. PTFE coated pans are not broiler-safe for this reason. (Note that PTFE itself is non-toxic, as it reacts chemically with almost nothing, the same reason it is extremely non-stick.)
* *Cleaning* They are very, very easy to clean since nothing will stick to the PTFE.
* *Durability* The PTFE coating will eventually break down, and so the pan will lose its non-stick properties.
* *Fond development* The browned bits at the bottom of the pan, which in in classic French cooking are called the *fond*, do not develop in a PTFE coated pan, since there is nothing for the fond to stick to. This may be an advantage or disadvantage.


Lids and Handles
================


The material the lid (if there is one), and handles is made from or covered with is also important.


It is highly desirable that the pot or pan be able to be used on the cooktop, in the oven, and even under the broiler (grill, I believe the British would say).


Non-metal materials that are not oven/broiler safe are a disadvantage. Plastic is especially problematic. Note that some hard phenolic type plastic materials can go into a moderate (up to about 450°F (230°C)) oven; read the manuals, but I recommend true metal handles.


Earthenware
===========


Earthenware cookware, such as a tagine, is a speciality item that is good for cooking braises, rice and couscous type dishes, and other slow cooking dishes. It is not a good general purpose item, as it cannot be used for high temperature frying, sautéing, and so on. They are generally used in the oven, although some small number of them are safe on top of the cook top.


Conclusion
==========


Different pan constructions are ideal for different applications.


A typical cook will want an assortment for different applications, although layered stainless steel from a quality manufacturer is often a good compromise across many applications.


* *Eggs and delicate foods* A PTFE coated pan, or a well seasoned cast iron pan.
* *Searing.* Cast iron (enamelled or not), or heavy stainless.
* *Sautéing* Layered stainless, possibly coated with PTFE depending on your desires, or cast iron.
* *Stir frying.* If using a wok, carbon steel is traditional, and is often the best, but this is a unique application.
* *Braising.* Layered stainless or cast iron (see searing for this, as well, as that is often the first step in braising).
* *Roasting*. Stainless, but price and weight tend to be the big factors.
* *Stock pot or pasta boiler*. Big. Inexpensive.
* *Butter melter* Cute. Okay, I own two of these, but I never use them. :-)

5,How can I make my own vinegar?,"How can I turn excess wine into delicious wine vinegar at home? For those who have done it, are there any useful tips to get the best results? 


I do not have access to any ""mother of vinegar"" starter culture, and am not likely to spend money on it; however, I DO have a well-stocked home kitchen and a lot of patience.


Edit: To be more specific about my questions


* How long should it take to ferment, and when do I give up if it's not vinegary?
* Do I need to add sugar/water for low-sweetness or high-alcohol wines?
* How do I collect Mother of Vinegar for use in fresh batches?

6,"Chilli con carne - chocolate, cocoa powder or nothing?","I am about to prepare chilli con carne. I have found more recipes than I would even like. I have quite an idea what ingredients and spices to put in. The last question is whether to use chocolate, cocoa powder or nothing. How do mexicans cook chilli con carne?


",<mexican-cuisine>,2015-05-21 12:06:12.157,57668,14,"The origin of chili con carne is actually from the American southwest, not Mexico. It's tex-mex, not mex. 


There are many variations on chili con carne, however if you go back to the earliest known recipes cocoa or chocolate are not on them. It's pretty basic, flavored mostly by cumin and chili. So if you want to make the most authentic chili to the origin then skip the cocoa. 


However, there are many good recipes out there which have chocolate or cocoa in them and they are as valid as any other, so it all comes down to personal taste. I add unsweetened cocoa powder to my chili because the bitterness balances out the acidity of the canned tomatoes, and I like the flavor combinations you get. The umami from the chocolate enhances the flavor, and I like the way it hits the tongue, it gives it more punch. 


Once I made a chili and split it into two, with one I added some cocoa powder, otherwise the chilis were identical. I served both and asked people which they liked better and the vast majority preferred the one with cocoa in it. You can also add a tsp or two of instance coffee instead although I don't think it's as good. Adding sweetened dark chocolate instead of cocoa powder works just as well, there's no much difference except the chocolate adds a bit of sweetness. The main benefit of using chocolate rather than cocoa powder is that you can try different varieties, however as it's just an undertone you aren't likely to notice. 


So it's all down to taste.

25,Difference between soup and stew,"What are the technical differences between a soup and a stew.


Specifically, I've always had some confusion on the differentation of stew and soup. For the most part, you can tell the difference by visual cues but sometimes some soup or stew looks ambigously in between and i can't tell the difference. For example, wikipedia shows a picture of this as soup:


![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/oRqsx.jpg)


Yet it looks more like a stew to me. And then it shows this as a stew:


![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2GD6v.jpg)


Yet that looks like a soup to me. So my main question is: What are the technical differences that determine whether it is a soup or a stew.


",<soup><language><stews>,2012-01-31 21:47:31.853,20963,30,"There really is no *practical* difference; the dictionary definition of a *soup* is:



> 
> a liquid food made by boiling or simmering meat, fish, or vegetables with various added ingredients.
> 
> 
> 


Which also applies to any stew you can conceive of.


The technical, highly-nuanced difference is that of emphasis and intent. Stewing is a method of cooking the solids (specifically, a slow, moist-heat method). When you make a beef stew, you are stewing the *beef*, which says nothing about what you're stewing it *in*. On the other hand, when you make a chicken soup (or a chicken stock or broth which is the base of a chicken soup) then your objective is essentially to make chicken-flavoured liquid - to extract the flavour of the solids *into* the liquid. If some flavourful solids remain, then that is incidental as opposed to intentional.


In practice, some flavour extraction is going to happen with a stew as well, it just so happens that the principal aim is to cook the meat/veggies. A soup is more likely to contain raw or barely-cooked ingredients, and a stew is more likely to preserve the original flavour of the solids and/or liquids, but that's a very broad generalization and what it boils down to (ha ha) in practice seems to be largely dependent on the culture and the dish itself.


A stew is *not* simply a thick or chunky soup, despite the fact that a lot of people think of it that way. As above, that seems to be *more common* with stews, but it's not part of the definition, and the French have half a dozen categories for thickened soups that could easily be described as having the overall consistency of a ""stew"".

0,How salty is olive brine?,"I'm looking to incorporate some Kalamata olive brine into olive bread dough to maximize flavor. How much will I have to reduce the other salt in the recipe?


",<bread><salt><olive>,2020-07-05 14:59:45.630,109483,2,"There is no single answer to this. Olives are packed in widely differing brine concentrations, and breads are made with widely different salt concentrations. If you start reading the labels of olives in the supermarket, you will find anything between 1.5 and 7-8% salt.


Luckily, the labels are also your solution here. Just read the label, assume that the olives have reached equilibrium with the brine (this is not too strong an assumption, if you decide to desalt olives at home, you will find that it works within 1-2 days) and calculate from there.

",<food-safety><vegetarian>,2020-06-16 01:14:07.243,109086,54,"There are no health concerns with microwaving food. Microwaves excite water molecules to heat food, they don't change food or make it dangerous. When a product says do not microwave it means one of 3 things:


1. The packaging is not meant to be microwaved: heating some types of packaging can cause bad tastes or smells in food, or cause the packaging to release unhealthy chemicals. Putting the food in a microwave safe dish solves this problem
2. Microwave heating causes undesirable texture changes in the food. Microwaving can sometimes cause a rubbery texture, or make it soggy
3. As @fraxinus rightly points out some foods can explode in the microwave, especially food with a shell or airtight covering of some sort like eggs and potatoes. Heat causes pressure to build until the shell or covering fails, causing a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly' as they say in the aerospace industry when something blows up


Number 2 is the most likely reason the package said do not microwave.

11,What type of rum to use when making vanilla extract?,"My mom just bought me some vanilla beans from Tahiti and said that the person she bought them from suggested using rum to make an extract. What type of rum should be used, white or dark rum, and is there a certain alcohol content that is needed to keep the extract stable and safe at room temperature?


",<alcohol><vanilla><extracts><rum>,2013-02-02 02:19:35.473,30636,7,"I've been making rum-based vanilla extract successfully at home for years. Here are my recommendations. Your basic ingredients are 80 proof rum, sugar and vanilla beans. At the recommended proportions, the rum and sugar are plenty effective preservatives. 


You can use either light or dark rum, but it should be a good ""call"" 80 proof rum and not a bargain bottom shelf rum. I most often use Ron Rico. If you use a golden rum, your extract will have a warmer taste suitable for spicy treats such as pumpkin pie or spice cookies. If you use a silver rum, your vanilla will have a purer taste suitable for whipped cream or custard sauces. I get rum that is bottled in glass, because I think plastic imparts an off flavor. 


Your basic recipe will use a fifth less about a 1/2 cup of rum, four vanilla beans and 1/2 cup of organic sugar. We'll go through that first, and then talk about variations. 


Place your vanilla beans on a clean, flat cutting surface. Using a small, sharp knife, cut them first in 1/2 crosswise at the middle. Then take each 1/2 bean and insert the knife tip just 1/2 to an inch below the uncut end and carefully slice lengthwise to the send. Repeat this process gently and carefully on each piece unti each piece has four lengthwise quarters attached at the uncut end. Some recipes will tell you to scrape some or all of the paste out of the beans, but this is not necessary. The simply split beans will infuse the rum just fine. 


Pour out about a cup of rum from your fifth and set aside. Put your sliced vanilla beans into the rum. Use a funnel to add 1/2 cup of organic sugar. Use the reserved rum you set aside to top the bottle back up. Recap the bottle and give it about 20 shakes to encourage the sugar to dissolve. Set aside in a dark cabinet or pantry. Take it out and give it a few shakes every week or so. Your vanilla will be usable but not fully extracted in about two months. It will continue to strengthen in flavor out to about 6 months of age. 


Once you are satisfied with your extract, you can decant some and bottle it up in smaller bottles. It's a very popular gift for bakers.


Once you have tried vanilla extract made this way, you will never want to go back to store-bought. The difference is indescribable. 


You can vary the type of rum you use, silver or gold, and you can vary the sugar. I mostly stick with light organic sugar, because I think the taste is better. I like the combination of dark rum and brown organic sugar very well. You can also increase the sugar up to about 2/3 cup in a fifth bottle, but I wouldn't go above that. Sugar gives the extract more body and mellows the flavor.


Check out Wikipedia to learn more about the various kinds of vanilla beans available. I use the organic ones from my food coop, but different kinds can be ordered online or found at specialty food stores. 


A number of cooking blogs have instructions on making extracts or tinctures of other spices. There is no reason not to create combination flavors.

9,Why baste bread with cornstarch?,"In [this sourdough recipe](http://www.food.com/recipe/classic-san-francisco-sourdough-bread-154142), it suggests basting the bread with a cornstarch slurry. I would assume this is meant to promote crust development, but how does that work? I usually see such a slurry used to thicken liquids. 


Other recipes that use this method:


* [Yankee Harvest sourdough](http://www.yankeeharvest.com/recipes/recipe41.html)
* [""Secrets of a Jewish Baker"" glaze](http://community.kingarthurflour.com/node/2765)

Edit: Do note that the question is ""Why cornstarch? How does that work?"". I understand the desire for a good crust, and I understand that the slurry is meant to promote crust development, but I fail to understand what it is about cornstarch that mimics good crust development. 


",<bread><cornstarch>,2012-02-23 18:49:17.517,22900,8,"I've seen bread recipes like the one that you described.


When bread is baked in an oven with steam- the starch in the crust is able to gelatinize before it all dries out and becomes crispy. This is what makes the crust crisp, shiny, and delicious- characteristic of ""artisan"" breads.


Most people don't have steam enhanced ovens (or the ability to hack their oven to add steam: [How can I create steam in a normal oven to promote bread oven spring?](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/21627/2001))


The recipe you linked has water added for steam but then takes out extra insurance (they cheat) by adding the cornstarch glaze to mimic the effect. By adding extra, pure, starch on the surface of the loaf more gelatinization occurs. Additionally, cornstarch gelatinizes at a lower temperature that wheat starch. Conceivably, you should be able to use any starch and see similar results but, in the US at least, cornstarch is by far the most common.


It shouldn't be necessary if you are able to produce enough steam in your oven.

I found this was the best solution for myself as I was able to serve hot and (almost)fresh out of the deep fryer food to a large group of people at lot faster. I think the result is way better than if you had to store the fully deep fried food for 2 hours and had to reheat it up somehow.

",<pork><marinade><spanish-cuisine><cut-of-meat>,2012-11-05 08:25:19.627,28235,2,"OK, with chops you have a some considerations, one is the quality of the port, next is how thick they are, last is how long you cook it. First, get the best quality you can. Get friendly with a butcher is my suggestion, as supermarket quality can be spotty. Next, get thicker chops. Your pork is probably tough because it is overcooked, and it is easy to overcook thin chops, so thicker chops stay juicier and more tender. Try to get them at least 1 inch or 2.5cm thick. You want your pork pink in the middle, not cooked through. 


Third is how long you fry them. For very thin chops no more than 3 minutes a side, but for 2.5cm ones do 6 minutes on the first side, and 4 on the other. Scale those times up for bigger chops. I use an app called BB Meat Master for my cooking times, but there are websites with the cooking times as well. 


Alternatively you could braise them, fry them off quickly, then pour in the marinade, cover, and cook for about 20 minutes depending on thickness.

The trouble is, I don't have a large frying pan or a large pot. I only have one small pot which I have free to use for the moose stew. The small bits of half of the moose meat fit in there with carrots and onions.


What should I do for the 4 other steak-sized chunks?


* Should I just store them unfried in the refrigerator and cook when I need to, which will be approximately week from now? (Currently they are in the refrigerator, but I can always fry them in my frying pan that is free now.)
* Should I fry them in my frying pan and store them in the refrigerator after frying them?


I want to maximize the amount of time the meat stays edible. If it stays edible for only one week from now, I have to eat moose meat every day. If it stays edible for two weeks, I can eat moose meat only every other day.


I of course theoretically have the option of just storing the rest in my freezer, but my freezer (or actually two freezers) are half full with frozen moose meat!

If you intend to cook it all as stew meat, then I would advise to cut it now and freeze (wherever you can find space).


If you coat the steaks in salt, they will probably last a bit longer in the fridge without getting too smelly.


The only way I would recommend pre-cooking to extend life, is a roast, which should enable meat to last an extra week in the refrigerator. But, if your cuts of meat are not suitable to roasting, then that might be terrible to eat.


The final option - which is again, a waste of good moose meat - would be jerky. I can't advise on jerky techniques. Never made it.

2,What could I substitute for coffee in an Opéra cake,"I would like to bake an [Opéra cake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_cake) for someone who doesn't really appreciate the taste of coffee. Since coffee and chocolate are the two main elements, I am wondering: what flavour could I substitute for coffee in my coffee buttercream? I suppose the qualities I'm looking for are a bit of bitterness, and it should go well with chocolate and orange liquor?




---


PS: I just noticed that the English wikipedia describes the sponge cake as “soaked with coffee”, but in the way I usually do it it's soaked with [Cointreau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cointreau) so I don't need any replacement there.


",<substitutions><cake><coffee><french-cuisine>,2012-04-27 03:34:06.760,23400,3,"Some sort of nutty flavor perhaps? Hazelnut syrup? I think it should go well with both chocolate and orange. Otherwise I think the cake will be quite delicious even without a substitute, just using plain buttercream. 


EDIT: I just noticed that the cake has an almond base. Perhaps a few drops of Amaretto in the buttercream would work. That would play nicely with the almond flavor already there.

10,Papadum sauces - making my own,"In Indian restaurants you get usually Papadum as appetizer. It is often served with 3 sauces, one green sauce with a light peppermint taste, one red a bit sweet sauce and one very hot sauce.


These sauces seem to taste often (but not always) very similar regardless of the restaurant. I tried to copy them (especially the green one) but so far the results were a bit disappointing.


Does anyone have an idea what these sauces are called or how they are made?


",<sauce><indian-cuisine>,2011-06-29 12:00:38.087,15839,17,"The sauces are called *chutney* (plural *chutneys*).


The green one, called *hari chutney* in Hindi, is generally made with a mixture of coriander (cilantro) leaves and mint leaves. *Hari* means green in Hindi. The leaves (I have used them in a 3:1::coriander:mint ratio) are ground to a fine paste along with a tbsp of sugar, a pinch of salt, and about 2 tbsp of lime juice (to prevent oxidation of the ground greens and to provide a tangy taste). Some variations of this may add ginger (for flavor) or peanuts (as a thickening agent) to the mixture.


The red chutney, called *imli chutney* in Hindi, is very often made with the juice of [tamarind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamarind) (*imli* in Hindi). Tamarind is soaked in water, strained and mixed with sugar, [rock salt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kala_Namak), toasted and ground cumin, dry powdered ginger, and powdered pepper. Rock salt and dry ginger give this chutney its distinct taste. Very often restaurants add artificial red color to this chutney to turn the color from brown to red.

-1,Why did my stew not taste sweet?,"I made a stew with garam masala and paprika only(<https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/bart-ground-paprika/007317-3405-3406>). I would have expected it to taste sweet however it didnt and was lacking in flavour.


I'm wondering what may have caused this e.g. is paprika water soluble such that the sweetness got diluted by water? does it need to be added in larger amounts to get any real flavour in a pot etc?


",<paprika>,2019-10-13 00:25:06.533,102849,4,"Sweet paprika isn't really sweet.


It's not hot (and not bitter), but just as we sometimes call non-spicy (bell) peppers *sweet peppers*, sweet isn't used in quite the way it is to describe other things (like apples). 


[*Dulce*](http://www.spanishcentral.com/translate/dulce), the Spanish word, correctly translates to *sweet* but it also translates to mild. *Doux* in French is related, but *gentle, mild, soft* are the main meanings. It's not just a translation issue though - fresh water was often described as *sweet* by sailors (and indeed does taste almost sweet after very salty food or swimming in the sea).


The fact that you found it lacking in flavour is more significant. I've always found that to get a dominant paprika flavour you have to use quite a lot, much more than with spicier spices. It would also provide quite a strong colour.
