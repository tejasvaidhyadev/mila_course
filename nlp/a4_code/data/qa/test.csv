Dried basil leaves instead of bay leaves,"I have to make an Indian curry which requires bay leaves. Apparently I don't have them at home. I read on google [here](https://www.spiceography.com/bay-leaves-vs-basil/) that dried Basil leaves can be a good substitute for bay leaves.
Now dried bay leaves, which we use in curries and soups have a strong flavor totally different from the minty flavour of Basil leaves.
Can anyone advice me on this, if someone has used this substitution.

How to de-seed a watermelon?,"It’s summer and watermelon time. I know [how to pick a good one](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/914/how-do-i-pick-a-watermelon-at-the-supermarket) (pro tip: a good greengrocer who has preselected the best batch on wholesale market). Then I cut myself a nice fat slice - and the problem starts. I am not a fan of watermelon seeds.


I grew up with watermelon served in wedges and then eaten by slicing off bite-sized chunks with a paring knife, removing the seeds as they appeared. But I would prefer to pre-cut the whole fruit in chunks, ready for portioning and then eating with just a fork or spoon.


No matter how I cut, there will always be seeds in the chunks and by the time I am done poking around with a paring knife, the pieces look like a crater landscape and there will still be some seeds left. Or I get small pieces floating in a lot of juice. Now, at home I can spit out the remaining seeds, but in the office, I’d rather spare my desk neighbor.


So how can watermelon be cut and deseeded cleanly and efficiently?

"What is this piece of fatty thing, inside a fish (a large snapper) which was near the roe?","I had a quite large female snapper, it had large amount of fish roe, but nearby it was an interesting piece looking like pure piece of fat, quite hard and solid.

Can you store dissolved rennet tablets?,"The rennet tablets I have are for large quantities of milk, 50 litres, much larger batches than I would ever make at home. However, separating out a tenth of a tablet is finicky and inaccurate, so I thought it might be better to dissolve half of or a quarter of a tablet in water, and doing the math to add the correct equivalent quantity of rennet solution each time. Can this reconstituted rennet be stored, if so, how and for how long?

How can I thicken/firm up this caramel?,"At the weekend, I made millionaire shortbread according to the recipe in Nigella Lawson's ""How To Be a Domestic Goddess"" (the full recipe is below for completeness). For the caramel part, Nigella uses a microwave and the instructions are as follows:



> 
> 200g butter
> 
> 
> 397g sweetened condensed milk
> 
> 
> 4 tbps (100g) golden syrup
> 
> 
> Melt 200g of butter in the microwave (in a large microwavable bowl)
> for 2-3 minutes, then add the condensed milk and golden syrup. Whisk
> the mixture well until the butter is thoroughly incorporated. Heat for
> 6-7 minutes until it is boiling, stirring thoroughly every minute.
> [...] It's ready when it's thickened and turned a light golden-brown.
> 
> 
> 


Now the result of this is delicious, but it is far too soft for millionaire's shortbread, and it squishes out the sides when trying to eat or cut. My partner has also made this recipe with the same results.


I don't really understand the science of caramel, so I'm not sure what to change to get the results I want. So I have a few questions:


1. **What can I change?** Is there something in the above recipe I can do more of, do less of, add more of, etc.?
2. The answer to [this question](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/94842/can-i-make-this-caramel-the-usual-way-instead-of-using-golden-syrup-and-conden) suggests that the above ingredients are more reliable (than standard caramel) for getting the right texture, but the [linked recipe](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/millionaires_shortbread_76712) does not use the microwave. Might I get better results without the microwave?
3. In Nigella's foreword, she advocates the use of the microwave as *""what would normally take a good couple of hours takes only a few minutes""*. Caramel does not take a couple of hours, does it? What is she talking about?

Does the strength of the barrier between egg yolk and white indicate freshness?,"Often you can plop eggs out of the shell on a pan nicely, so that the yolk remains whole and doesn't leak out to mix with the white. But other times, the barrier between the yolk and the white is so fragile, that there is some disintegration and some of the yolk leaks out when you try to get it on the pan. Also it becomes difficult to separate the yolk and white.


Does this indicate the eggs are less fresh?


I have the eggs sitting in ambient temperature of 30°C (around 86°F for those using exotic units), this is the room temperature. I have a suspicion that this (egg yolk leaking) happens more for eggs which have been sitting more days since collection, but I am not sure yet if there is a correlation.

2. In a large mixing bowl, add all the ingredients and mix until fully incorporated.
3. Pour batter into muffin liners until close to the top.

Trouble making a crunchy dog treat,"I am very new to recipe development and I am trying to replicate a dog treat. The store bought treat is hard and crunchy. Using just the ingredient list, when I try to bake the same thing, it comes out looking similar yet when I go to pick it up it immediately crumbles.

Ingredients to work with:
Wheat Flour, Wheat Bran, Peanut Butter, Peanuts, Ground Brown Rice, Oil


I’ve adjusted the amount of peanut butter and oil to various ratios but every time it comes out crumbling to the touch.

How can I render bacon fat without frying it?,"I wanted to render the fat from some bacon to produce bacon grease.
The usual advice that you see on the internet is to simply fry whole strips of bacon at a low heat, for a longer period, and the fat will melt away from the meat proper. That normally works for me.


The other day I wanted to try someting different. I have previously rendered other fats in different ways. I've tried a 'wet render', by simmering at a very low temperature in water. That worked well for lamb fat. And I tried a 'dry render' by putting the fat in the oven at a lowish temperature (gas mark 3 = 160C), which worked well for chicken skin.


I tried these methods with some bacon fat, that I had cut off from the meat of back bacon strips. So it was just 16 white strips of cold fat. But they didn't work. With the wet render, no matter how long I simmered for, the water didn't get more than a tiny bit oily. The dry render behaved similarly, except that it did give a tiny bit of fat, but nearly all of the fat was still whole, the bits hadn't reduced in size at all after I baked for about 5 hours.


Why didn't it work? At first I thought the temperature might be too high, but it's not like the bits were getting blackened or anything. And surely a higher temperature would also show signs of rendering the fat, it wouldn't just arrest the entire process.

How to make authentic black Russian bread?,"I'm trying to re-create the authentic black Russian bread that was first mass produced during soviet times. Nowadays you can find it in any Russian market and many international supermarkets in the US.


The problem is most recipes I can find online either:


1. Use a lot of additives such as cacao powder and coffee to color the bread, which don't seem historically plausible


or


2. Don't achieve nearly the same dark shade as the pre-packaged store variants


Anecdotally, my dad claims that this bread was sold in the Soviet Union in his youth as the cheapest bread available, for those who couldn't afford bread made from finely milled wheat. At its initial inception it was mass produced by the state and supposedly didn't taste great (although it did have that dark black color). Considering it was the cheapest bread around, it seems highly unlikely it was created with cacao or espresso powder in soviet times.


Eventually, people started prizing this bread more and recipes evolved until we got the modern variant which most people (at least in Russia) find appetizing. It's possible the modern variant uses the more expensive color impacting ingredients, but it seems more likely that some trick that was used to make the original ""dirt cheap"" black bread is still employed or borrowed from today.


I’ve made a number of different variants following the recipes online and overall I’m happy with the results in terms of taste, but it’s driving me crazy that I can’t figure out how to make the loaf authentically black.

How to extract mouth numbing effect from Sichuan peppercorn into a syrup?,"I tried following the recipe [here](https://www.f1cookbook.com/blog/sichuan-peppercorn-cocktails) to try to create a Sichuan peppercorn simple syrup. The recipe is basically to add slightly crushed peppercorn to sugar and water, allow to simmer, take off the heat, and repeat.

**How can I get the mouth numbing effect into a syrup, and why did the above method not work?** The Wikipedia article on [hydroxy alpha sanshool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxy_alpha_sanshool) suggests you can extract it with a distillation method although that seems like a bit of overkill when I am just trying to make cocktails at home (and when I don't own a condenser or distillation flask).

Burnt milk uses,"Though infrequently, when boiling milk, it gets burnt if you forget about the milk on stove.
I usually boil 2-3L of milk in one big pan on stove/induction.
When it gets burnt, it develops a peculiar smell and taste and in our house nobody can bear it.
Even if I make curd or cottage cheese from that milk, they all have that burnt flavour.
Hence I have to throw that whole quantity of milk.


Hence, is there anyway of removing that bad burnt flavour or else, utilising that flavoured milk into something which can be consumed by us?

"Experimenting with garlic, does cooking kill the flavour?","I have been experimenting by adding extra cloves of garlic into my pasta sauce every time I cook it. I make a quick pasta sauce by caramelizing onions in a pan, adding very finely chopped fresh garlic (its practically a paste), and whatever other vegetables is my pick for the night. Then I add chopped tomatoes/passata and reduce.


It seems to me no matter how much garlic I add, I do not get a harsh flavour. I just get a nice, deep, complex yet subtle flavour that I wouldn't instantly attribute to garlic.


I am currently at the stage where I am adding more than half a bulb of garlic to a one person sauce.


Is there any point in adding this much garlic? Is the garlic responsible for this ""nice, deep, complex flavour""? Would the same effect be achieved with less garlic which is more coarsely chopped?


I understand that the longer garlic cooks, the weaker the ""garlic"" flavour gets, but is this flavour disappearing or is it developing into a new flavour?

Is there any substitute for butter (or oil) on puff pastry?,"I tried to create puff pastry.


For medical reasons I should minimize the fat on my recipe. Puff pastry is mainly made by 3 important ingredients, flour, water, and fat (butter or oil).


Unfortunately, I learned that butter and oil, consist of 100% fat. I've successfully created puff pastry using oil in a pan before. It works! I create 2 doughs, one dough is formed using flour and water, the other one is using flour and oil. Then, I do the pastry folding.


So as no-fat alternative I tried using a flour-water dough and a flour-applesauce dough, laminated as for regular puff pastry. The result was crisp at the outside, but uncooked on the inside.


I baked twice as long, and the result were very thick hard crackers. I can see the layers with different color, but there is no air in between the layers.


I've also tried only using flour-water dough pastry, folded. Again I can see different colors of the layera, but no air in between.


I haven't tried making the second dough with egg yolks though. It may interesting to see the result, since egg yolks supposedly have around 63% of fat.


**Research**


After that failed experiment, I read some articles about the science behind the pastry. It says that the pocket of air is formed because of the boiled water that becomes gas, trapped between the fat layers.


I assume, it happens because the oil and water are not soluble. On the other hand, the boiling point of water is 100 C (212 F), yet the boiling point of oil is around 300 C (572 F). I see [here](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/1227/boiling-point-of-vodka) that vodka has a boiling point around 78.3 C, which is lower than water. I haven't tried vodka for the mixture with flour because vodka actually is also soluble in water.


My question is:


Is there any food grade liquid that has boiling point over 100 C and is not soluble in water?

Additional flour threshold: when and how to perform?,"For whatever reason (in my case, usually rookie mistakes), sometimes dough - after no additional flour - is worked/kneaded to a point where it does not reach a supple state/texture and instead is more porridge-like than anything else.


It is at this point I find myself sometimes, and I'm wondering how I can consistently and efficiently resolve this issue with a simple approach.

Can sour cherries be used in a semi-stable bar?,"I have recently [learned](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/q/68688/48599) that my carb intake is insufficient, leading to so-called ""glycogen depletion"" while cycling. I have possibly spent too much time around folks who boast of equating a healthy diet with a diet that is partially or fully deficient in carbs. I followed, not realizing the consequences.


Mid bike ride it turns out that a cyclist needs (immediate) simple sugar, in addition to some more complex carbs. At this time of the year sour cherries make their way to the market in vast quantities, but they spoil extremely quickly and must be frozen.


I've tried in the past freezing in zipper bags, intending to eventually learn how to make a proper pie (I never did). Now I'm thinking that there could be another pertinent use for them: cherry bars that are dry enough to carry along on a bike ride, and where the cherries have stabilized enough so that they do not spoil quite as rapidly as they normally do. The need for simple sugars would be satisfied by the cherries; the need for complex sugars by the crust.


My first experiment was to simply add them, in large quantities, to a standard brownie mix. That didn't fare so well. The mixture was too moist to cook uniformly—edges cooked, inside not so much—even after leaving for extra time in the oven. Worse, after a day in the fridge some of the cherries have turned color from the characteristic ""still good"" bright red to a dull ""likely spoiled"" crimson red.


Can sour cherries be used in a semi-stable bar? The idea is that I'd use the whole lot (5 kg!) and have ample supply in the freezer.

It continued to smoke for a few minutes, and I suspect that that means it's not ready for cooking, but I'm not quite sure what the smoke means.

Would just leaving it like that (**still on the stove at the Maillard setting**, *not* in the oven) for 30 minutes do the trick?

Making tomato mix thicker without surge in calories,"I got on trying to eating more healthy and as a part of that, I take a few tomatoes, cucumber and garlic and blend that into a sort of a drink. It's far more convenient and quick to smash a bunch of veggies into a blender and mix the crap out of them, rather than slicing and hacking. It also scales better - making a mixaroo of 3 or of 5 tomatoes takes the same amount of time, whereas slicing time is proportional. So I'm aiming at eliminating any obstacles along the way to wiser food choices.


I'd like to make it less liquidish, aiming for a thicker texture. I've tried adding broccoli, cauliflower, nuts and seeds. I tried adding oat flower and soy protein powder. It gave an improvement but to be acceptably substantial, I need to push in quite a lot, which kind of defeats its purpose.

3. Do birds (turkey, ..) require special attention because they spoil particularly rapidly, and for a lamb one would get away with defrosting at room temperature? Would 24 hours do it? Would that be actually safe?


I suppose if it's October or March, then defrosting outside in some regions at +5C might work, except that the temperature outside is never constant, which doesn't help much (with either defrosting or with food safety), and that you'd have to stand guard overnight to make sure no *other* wild animal discovers what feast is ready for them.

How does my pre-cooked Costco chicken breast not expire for another 5 weeks?,"I bought some ""fully cooked chicken breast strips"" that are seasoned and has grill lines on them. They're quite tasty. Ingredients also include salt, potato starch, and vinegar.


The label says ""best before"" a date that is 5 weeks from now. I don't think there is enough salt or vinegar to preserve these since the chicken tastes like normal chicken and these aren't ""cured"" or pickled or the like. My understanding is cooked chicken usually goes bad after about 5-7 days.

I would like to have most of the concepts taught by cooking, but I'm not a great cook myself. So, I'm looking for suggestions for things that I may be overlooking. There are other questions here asking about the science of cooking, but are generally geared towards adults. I'm hoping to get ideas for something that teaches science to children and is useful for everyday cooking. Here are some of the things I have so far:


* Maillard reaction
* fermentation/yeast (making yogurt, kefir, sourdough)
* Carmelization
* Osmotic pressure (pickling, curing meat, etc)
* Altitude effects (boiling point, adding flour, pressure cookers, etc)
* thickeners (molecular structure, etc)

How do I determine roasting temperature as a function of time?,"TL;DR


If it takes 90 minutes to roast a leg of lamb at some temperature (perhaps somewhere from 350 to 450 °F?), and it takes 840 minutes to slow-roast a leg of lamb of the same exact weight at some other temperature (possibly 175 to 275 °F?), what is the temperature setting that one should use if one wants the leg of lamb to spend 420 minutes in the oven? Is it suitable to calculate the temperature using linear interpolation?


*The mid-length story:*


The purpose of the question is to avoid the tyranny of recipes, where I have to go to my tablet, computer, or book shelves to do anything. I'd like to understand the ideas (in this case, for roasting lamb or beef) well enough to be able to cook without the handholding of recipe authors.


In this era of internet-sourced recipes, recipes seem to be, by and large, copied, or inspired (possibly even sometimes plain plagiarized). For example, search online for ""roast leg of lamb"" and you will find a hundred pundits claiming to provide a recipe. Search for ""slow roast leg of lamb"" and you will find more results. But these recipes are not gospel. We should be able to do anything we want, so long as it's flavorful and healthy. Is there such a thing as semi-slow, average-slow, and rather-fast-than-slow roasting, or are we stuck with just ""roasting"" and ""slow roasting""?


*The long story:*


Cooking a whole lamb, starting by [defrosting](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/110036/85398) it, will have to remain a 5- or 10-year project, when I will know that I can nail every detail right, and when I will know that a 40-or-so-large family reunion will happen, if they're ever in the same place at the same time.


At this time I have the much more modest objective of properly cooking a leg of lamb, defrosted for 36 hours in the fridge


[![uncooked leg of lamb](https://i.stack.imgur.com/hJOoq.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/hJOoq.png)


and smeared with mustard, rosemary, and garlic


[![mustard, rosemary, and garlic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VxM8G.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VxM8G.png)


My intention was to leave it in the oven overnight at 275 °F / 135 °C. Slow roasting is much more of a foolproof method, because I don't have to calculate precise minutes-per-weight numbers. If it's in the oven two hours more or an hour less, it's still perfectly alright. (Yes, yes, no need to lecture me about food safety; I do make sure that the internal thermometer reading reaches whatever the thermometer says.)


Here is the problem: I really don't want the flavor, the texture, or, as mentioned above, the time sensitivity of roasting at 375 °F / 190 °C. I would like the fall-off-the-bone tenderness of 275 °F / 135 °C, *but*.


I was much too tired (tennis for just one hour did it) to think about standing on my feet for the 5-10 minutes that it takes to prepare the roast before going to bed. I'm starting to roast early in the morning instead, for guests who will arrive 420 minutes after the roast went to the oven.


If I need 90 minutes at 375 °F / 190 °C and 840 minutes (14 hours) at 275 °F / 135 °C, I am speculating that there is a precise temperature that I can use for 420 minutes, and the roast will be just perfect when the guests arrive. (Then the roast will rest outside during chatting and appetizers.)


*How do I determine roasting temperature as a function of time?* Would, for example, linear interpolation



```
375 + (420-90) * (275-375) / (840-90) = 331 °F

```

make sense?


N.B.: This might be a difficult question, in the sense that cookbooks do not discuss it. Feel free to ""throw me a bone"", figuratively speaking, and make a suggestion that I can try. If the roast is under-cooked, I can always use one of various remedies and apologize that I didn't get it quite right. The guests will be gracious. But if a better answer comes along later, it's fairer, and better fitting for a reference site, that I update the ""correct"" answer. Cooking is an art form anyway. There isn't just ""right"" and ""wrong"".

Why am I not getting any smoke out of my smoking pouch?,"I am cooking some brisket on a gas grill. Following YouTube tutorials I made a smoking pouch/smoke bomb just like the ones they do on YouTube and filled it with newly purchased smoking pellets. As suggested I sealed the pouch, poked holes in it, placed it on top of a burner on one end, and turned the burner on high. I placed the brisket at the other end. Initially the temperature reached 300 degrees Fahrenheit with that single burner on high. Later I lowered it down to hold the temperature around 225-250. Strangely I haven't seen any smoke coming out of the smoking pouch. No action there whatsoever. One of the holes has gathered a tiny bit of brownish gooey stuff. That's it.

Solutions for a bland vegetable curry,"Over the years, I have developed a recipe that is effectively [aloo gobi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloo_gobi) and [saag aloo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saag) mixed together: Potato, cauliflower, broccoli and spinach curry. (I used to make it with sweet potato, but to ""please"" all my diners, I've switched to regular potatoes...which is also more authentic.)


Anyway, the curry gravy is fried black mustard seeds, browned-off onions, ground fenugreek, ground turmeric, hot chilli powder, ground coriander, diced ginger, red chillies, dried curry leaves and chopped tomatoes. The vegetables are roasted and added to the gravy after it's stewed for a while (20-40 minutes, say). Then I mix through the spinach at the end.


When I first started making this, I remember it tasting better than it does now. It always tastes bland, nowadays. If there's any spice, it's mostly from the ginger; even if I minimise its quantity (or remove it altogether) and focus instead on the fenugreek and chilli. I roast the vegetables specifically for the Malliard reaction and to sweeten them up, but it doesn't help much. Often, the overwhelming flavour is the tomato, but the gravy dries out and burns if you don't use enough.


It's quite frustrating and, because there are so many variables, I'm not sure where I'm going wrong. I have tried adding more spice; it doesn't really make a difference. I have tried leaving the gravy to ""infuse"" for longer; that helps to a point, but with diminishing returns. My spices are just supermarket spices -- nothing fancy -- but relatively new, so shouldn't have lost their potency. Should I toast them first? Salting the vegetables doesn't make any difference. Some recipes I've seen post-fry the vegetables to crisp them up, but I don't see how that can work with a gravy-based curry.

Using proofed (?) yeast in a recipe (confused about amounts),"I'm following a recipe that begins with ""process 3.25 cups flour and 1/8 tsp instant or rapid-rise yeast in food processor until combined, then slowly add 1.25 cup ice water""


On the instant yeast packaging, it says to mix 2.25 tsp yeast with 1/4 cup warm water and 1 tsp sugar, let stand for 10 min, then follow recipe.


I'm not sure if I'm supposed to


1. Ignore the packaging directions and stick 1/8 tsp dry instant yeast pellets into the recipe
2. Use the ratio of water:yeast from the packaging with 1/8 tsp yeast, i.e. mix 0.125/2.25 (tsp yeast) = x/.25 (water) = mix .125 tsp yeast with 1/72 cups of water


2a. If so do I use 1 cup ice water in the recipe, or 1.25cup minus .0138 ice water?
3. Mix the yeast/water/sugar together, let stand for 10 min, then use 1/8tsp of the resultant mixture for the recipe


Also how to reconcile the warm vs ice cold water directions?


**Edit: Full recipe and context as requested**


It's from a recipe for lahmajun, Turkish pizza (although the author contends that pizza should be called Italian lahmajun :)). It's Cooks Illustrated, so helpfully the author describes what they want to achieve and some of the science behind it (I highly recommend the magazine!): <https://www.cooksillustrated.com/articles/2457-my-best-lahmajun> ""On a Roll"" section I think this explanation (which I reread after getting my answers--thanks guys!) probably makes it clear to most readers to ignore the yeast packaging instructions, but I'd never made dough before and wasn't sure.


Ingredients


* 3.25 cups (16.25 oz) King Arthur All-Purpose flour
* 1/8 tsp instant or rapid-rise yeast
* 1.25 cups (10oz) ice water
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1.5 tsp table salt
* vegetable oil spray


Directions


1. Process flour and yeast in food processor until combined, about 2 seconds. With processor running, slowly add ice water, process until dough is just combined and no dry flour remains, about 10 seconds. Let dough rest for 10 min.
2. Add oil and salt and process until dough forms shaggy ball, 30-60 sec. Transfer dough to lightly oiled counter and knead until uniform, 1 min (texture will remain slightly rough). Divide dough into 4 equal pieces, about 6.66 oz each. Shape dough pieces into tight balls and transfer, seam side down, to rimmed backing sheet coated with oil spray. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 16 hours or up to 2 days.
3. Make topping (combine lamb, spices, and veggies in food processor)
4. One hour before baking lahmajun, remove dough from fridge and let stand at room temperature until slightly puffy and no longer cool to touch. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to upper-middle position (rack should be 4-5"" from broiler element), set baking stone on rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees.
5. Place 1 dough ball on unfloured counter and dust top lightly with flour. Using heel of your hand, press dough ball into 5"" disk. Using rolling pin, gently roll into 12"" round of even thickness. (Use tackiness of dough on counter to aid with rolling; if dough becomes misshapen, periodically peel round from counter, reposition, and continue to roll.) Dust top of round lightly but evenly with flour and, starting at 1 edge, peel dough off counter and flip, floured side down, onto floured baking peel (dough will spring back to about 11"" in diameter). Please 1/4 of topping (about 1/2 cup) in center of dough. Cover dough with 12 by 12"" sheet of plastic and, using your fingertips and knuckles, gently spread filling evenly across dough, leaving 1/8"" border. Starting at 1 edge, peel away plastic, leaving topping in place.
6. Carefully slide lahmajun onto stove and bake until bottom crust is browned, edges are lightly browned, and topping is steaming, 4-6min. While lahmajun bakes, begin rolling next dough ball.
7. Transfer baked lahmajun to wire rack. Repeat rolling, topping, and baking remaining 3 dough balls.

Will gum arabic stabilize a watery sorbet?,"I’ve been struggling with getting an iced tea based sorbet to not end up as a chunk of ice; I believe the canonical answer here is “use a stabilizer.”


I grabbed some gum arabic (mastic to be specific) recently to play with gomme syrup for cocktails, which gave me an idea: will it stabilize a sorbet? It should have the nice advantage of not requiring cooking the way gelatins do, AFAIK it can be activated by blending.

How to make best milk chocolate at home?,"I have eaten home-made chocolate before, and while it was pretty good, it could not compare with the expensive chocolate at the store.


I would like to make the best milk chocolate I can at home. From what I know, the main ingredients are: cocoa powder, some fat (such as butter, coconut oil, etc.), powdered milk, water, and sugar.


I guess my question is, do you have any advice (or recipe) for making a really good milk chocolate? Some particular questions I have are:


1. Which is the best fat to use? Is it cocoa butter (I have trouble finding cocoa butter at the store)?
2. Is the powdered milk found at the store really the best for making chocolate? Is it better to make my own powdered milk?
3. Are there any other ingredients that are recommended for high-quality milk chocolate? I have seen soy lecitin, should I use this?

Is it possible to effectively dissolve chocolate into coffee?,"The combination of milk chocolate with coffee is very good. The classic strategy is to take a bite of chocolate, chew it for five seconds, and then sip some coffee.


This strategy can be inconvenient at times, so I thought of dissolving the chocolate directly into hot coffee. However, this did not work very well due to the chocolate's fat content. How can I effectively mix chocolate into coffee?

How does repeatetly moving food from freezer to fridge and back every day affect it?,"My fridge and freezer makes noise to the point that it is hard for me to sleep (even with earplugs) so I have began to shut off the power to the fridge and freezer during the night. My fridge is set to 1 degree celsius and my freezer is set to -18 degrees celsius.


When I go to sleep I move all the fridge items such as milk, cheese, butter, meat, kefir to the freezer and shut the power off for 9-12 hours when I sleep. When I wake up again, I turn the power back on, wait about an hour or so and put my items back in the fridge. The freezer temperature when I turn the power back on is around 3-4 degrees.


I don't feel ill when I eat the food, all I have noticed is ice crystals in the milk and that the cheese is a bit harder to slice.

How to make ice cream base using evaporated milk easier to work with?,"I sometimes try to make “chewy” ice cream using evaporated milk or dulce de leche made using the “boil a can of sweetened condensed milk” method in the base.


For the batch I’m wrangling now, I used a 14oz can of dulce de leche, 3 cups of heavy cream, a uhh... lot(?) of cocoa powder (I just added more until the dairy looked like it’s not getting darker anymore) and a 4oz bar of dark chocolate. (The dulce de leche adding around 220g of sugar.)


When chilled, this thickened into a puddingy paste that barely flows without coaxing, and my (cheap) ice cream machine started being unable to move it in about 10-15 minutes. (Although a thermometer registered the mixture as below freezing near the middle-ish.)


I usually just pry this out of the machine and into the freezer because what else am I going to do, and end up with fairly tough, albeit not icy icecream.


Is there anything that would make this base easier to work with without significantly changing the ingredients? Recipes for this style of ice cream usually have even more evaporated milk compared to the rest in them, sometimes even adding egg yolks which would likely thicken this even more. (Based on my experiences making chocolate+caramel icecream, replacing sugar in the recipe with caramel made out of it seems to make it so that using egg yolks is the difference between having the base churnable or not.)


I’ve been debating whipping the liquid up (or maybe just tossing it into a blender) before and after chilling to aerate it before it goes into the churn - after all it’s mostly cream and should be around 25% butterfat, but I have no idea if this would be helpful, and maybe there’s better tricks.

Beating egg whites cold vs. warm - Japanese cheesecake,"Namiko Chen's [recipe](https://www.justonecookbook.com/souffle-japanese-cheesecake/) for Japanese cheesecake specifically requires that the egg whites be beaten chilled. I have also asked my Japanese friends to check other Japanese recipes and they get the same instructions. On the other hand, Western recipes for Japanese cake calls for the egg whites to be beaten at room temperature. I assume that since Japanese souffle cheesecake is originally from Japan, the Japanese version is the ""correct"" one and that the room-temperature requirement is a modification by Westerners who copied the recipe.


I have tried Namiko's recipe with great results. The egg whites took quite some time to beat, but they remained stable even without cream of tartar. I presume beating the egg whites cold will take a longer time but will give more stability, but is this something that's well-known? I know that the same holds for cream, I just have never read it for egg whites.

Can these or the cooked base be pre-treated using the lactase pills I keep around to make them lactose free? And how would I go about this re: heating or time required?

"""Lime water"" technique -- why use an excess of cal?","At <https://www.catsfork.com/CatsKitchen/lime-water> I see a technique from a cookbook called Nourishing Traditions for soaking cornmeal in 'lime water', created from pickling lime (calcium hydroxide, aka ""cal""). The technique starts by preparing a quart of lime water by adding a quart of filtered water to something like a half a cup of pickling lime powder, sharing, letting the powder settle out, and then using the water obtained by pouring the liquid portion off of the settled solids.


I am confused because according to the solubility table at <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility_table>, something like 2 grams of calcium hydroxide would be expected to dissolve in a quart of water. That's basically one mL of calcium hydroxide that is expected to dissolve; why would you use a half cup (which is approximately a hundred times that amount)?


Am I missing something about the technique? Is there a reason why using a dramatic surplus might be anything other than wasteful?

How long would meat stored (in jars) and fish (whole) in a ice-water bath last?,"For various reasons I'd like to store fresh meat and fish without freezing for as long as possible. I should preserve its original state as fresh and taste, so salting, cooking, vinegar is out of the question.


I have this idea to put meat in glass jars (with empty space filled up with ghee or tallow to eliminate air which degrades meat too), and fish as whole fish (with skin and scales, I just remove the intestines and gallbladder before storage), in water-ice bath. The idea is to keep constant temperature just above freezing, i.e. around 0.5°C (33°F).


I could set-up the ice bath in a double Styrofoam container and replace deep frozen plastic bottles with water made in the freezer daily. Would this keep my meat and fish in as close to fresh state as possible for longer then simply sitting in the refrigerator (where temperatures will vary by a few degrees due to the duty cycle and opening the door)? Is anything like this practised with success and how long would meat (specifically beef, lamb, goat) and fish (e.g. snapper, barracuda, salmon) keep fresh like this?

Why are my tangzhong bread doughs so wet?,"I've started experimenting with [tangzhong](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2018/03/26/introduction-to-tangzhong) bread recipes after reading about it in one of the questions here. I have been baking bread for many years.


I believe I'm doing it correctly, but I find that the doughs are very wet and sticky - like, almost like a wet muffin batter that you might pour into a muffin tin instead of the usual smooth, non-sticky mass of bread dough that I am used to.


The recipes I've tried so far are:


* <https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/classic-sandwich-bread-recipe>
* <https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/soft-cinnamon-rolls-recipe>
* <https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/pillowy-white-bread-recipe>


They have all turned out OK, but only after I added a fair amount of additional flour, above and beyond what the recipe calls for.


Taking the [milk bread recipe](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/pillowy-white-bread-recipe) as an example:


The recipe calls for a total of 2 1/2 cups (dough) + 2 tablespoons (tangzhong) bread flour and 1/2 cup (dough) + 6 tablespoons (tangzhong) milk and water. That's a total of 2 3/8 cups flour to 7/8 cup of liquid.


The recipe calls for mixing & kneading ""until a smooth, elastic dough forms"". I use a stand mixer, and the recipe advises that this could take up to 15 minutes. So I did that, and after that time I did not have a smooth, elastic dough - I had a sticky mess at the bottom of the bowl. So I proceed to add more flour, two tablespoons at a time, until it becomes the smooth mass that I'm used to - in this case, I had to add close to another cup of flour to get it to what I believe bread dough should be.


The end result was good, but given that I've had the same experience three times with three different recipes, I have to wonder if it's something I'm doing or if there's something wrong with the recipes I'm trying (they are all from the same source, after all, so maybe there's something wrong there).

Food dye to simulate stained glass,"I have a recipe for stained glass crepes, now my question is this:what food coloring could be used to simulate stained glass for said crepes?


READY IN: 1hr 10mins
SERVES: 4-7
YIELD: 7 crepes
UNITS: US
INGREDIENTS
Nutrition
1  cup flour
1  cup sugar
1  egg
1  cup milk
1  teaspoon vanilla
12  lolly pops, crushed


DIRECTIONS
Mix the dough according to taste by muffin method. (The muffin method is when you put the wet stuff on top of the dry stuff and mix it together with as little stirring as possible fyi).
Form dough into the shape you want the crepe to be.
Add the crushed lollipops into the spaces between the dough spaces that are open.
Bake for 30 minutes to a hour or until the lollipop pieces are molten.
Wait until they are cool enough to touch and then remove with spatula.
These are the directions for my recipe in question. Can food dye be used to substitute for the crushed lollipops?

Collecting acorns to eat - how/when?,"Acorns of many oak species are edible.


They've been used as food in many traditions, but almost all need boiling and/or soaking to leach out the tannins. I'm curious to try them, as nuts, [a hot drink](http://allrecipes.co.uk/recipe/33207/acorn-coffee.aspx), or ground into flour for baking. I'm particularly interested in the European Oak (a.k.a Quercus robur, English or Common Oak) as I have several growing over my garden.


I've found plenty of sources on how to prepare them, but little on how to select them. I assume they should be brown to be ripe, but do I need to get up and pick them as soon as they turn brown, or are fallen ones good? Apart from obvious signs that something has started eating them, is there anything I should beware of?


Update:


Even after discarding the floaters I had to throw away quite a few. they were quickest to shell by quartering them lengthways with a sharp knife.
Unroasted ground acorns worked well in place of ground almonds in a biscuit (cookie) recipe, but the coffee substitute has a flavour closer to malty than nutty and isn't great. I may not have roasted the acorns enough, because despite leaching until they weren't bitter, they turned dark brown on drying so I couldn't see how roasted they were.

Is there a rubric for what ingredients go into a Chinese stir fry?,"Looking at these two recipes:


1. <https://omnivorescookbook.com/tofu-and-broccoli/>
2. <https://omnivorescookbook.com/ginger-chicken/>


they are quite similar but have minor variations. This seems to be the case for a lot of Chinese cooking - there are many recipes that use slightly different quanities or omit a single ingredient but are recognised as a different dish.


For example the **ginger chicken** contains



```
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon dark soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon rice vinegar

```

but the **tofu stir fry by the same chef** contains



```
1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
2 teaspoons dark soy sauce
1 teaspoon soy sauce
2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine

```

And then for **another ginger chicken** recipe (<https://thewoksoflife.com/ginger-chicken/>), the sauce has



```
1/4 cup Shaoxing wine
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
2 teaspoons oyster sauce (optional)

```

What confuses me is that distinguishing between ginger chicken and another chicken stir fry seems to rely on these small variations in flavours.


But these variations aren't consistent between chefs, so is there really just one ""mother"" stir fry recipe that you can tweak to your preference? Or do the variations actually result in something that you could tell apart by what you get on the table without knowing what its called?

Canning Tomatoes: When are they too blemished and why does it matter?,"In every canning recipe I have seen, the recipe calls for **unblemished tomatoes**, but this has never been explained further. The sources of these recipes has been on various internet sites (the kind with the interminable story preceding the recipe about how the great-aunt-twice-removed used to love this recipe), on recipe cards left by my relatives, and in that venerable bible of preservation: The Ball Blue Book.


### What is the reason we should avoid a blemish?


Surely there is some good reason blemish = evil. My guesses on the matter:


1. A blemish makes it harder to blanch.
2. The blemish through the surface of the skin allows bacteria to penetrate into the flesh.
3. A blemish may indicate the presence of a bigger problem with the tomato.


### Are all blemishes equal?


Consider the following from my wife's garden:


**Case 1**


[![This is an image of a tomato which has begun splitting longitudinally.  The split is deep but relatively fresh.](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OARut.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OARut.jpg)


This tomato (heirloom: Principe Borghese) has been over-watered and has begun to split. The split has begun to show blackening on the edge. When I was canning the batch when this tomato was picked, it was still fresh and unblackened. To me, it looks someone made skin cut too deep prior to blanching.


**Case 2**


[![This large tomato is a variety which is both red and green.  There are several wide growth splits which radiate out near the stem.](https://i.stack.imgur.com/viFEP.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/viFEP.jpg)


This ugly looking specimen is typical for the ""Purple Cherokee"" heirloom variety. The large fruit grow quickly and every specimen we have picked shows the same radial splits. The green and dark red is typical for the variety as well.


**Case 3**


[![This tomato appears to have some small black dots at the bottom of a crease in the skin.](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zGjxf.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zGjxf.jpg)


This is a tomato, another Principe Borghese which has been attacked by an unknown insect. The little black dots are very small bore holes through the skin. I assume that this tomato is the most obvious unacceptable example, but I wanted to include it anyway to see what the experts think about this kind of defect.


### Is this some old piece of granny wisdom which has been lost to us?


Ideally, I'd like to have a reference for this. Scientific literature is a plus.

Is it safe to keep reusing a portion of old dough?,"My grandma told my mum a weird process of making flatbread dough recently that she started to use. But I am not sure about it's safety at all.


* Initially, normal wholewheat bread dough made with Instant Yeast. Used to make bread but a small piece is kept (~70-100gm) in refrigerator.
* Next day, when making new dough, that 70-100gm portion of old dough is mixed in and it's allowed to rise for 2-3 hours.
* A 70-100gm portion of this mixture is kept again in refrigerator and mixed in next day.
* Repeat same everyday.


The result is definitely great for the flatbread naan but I am not sure about safety of this.


**Question:** Wouldn't a small part of it be too old after 2 weeks or so? I am sure some of of the old dough remains, however diluted. Mom claims she'd start process totally fresh after a month but I believe that's too long.

Should I reshape refrigerated pizza dough into ball again when taking it out of the fridge?,"I made a pizza dough and put it in the fridge until tomorrow. 100% wheat flour, 68% water, 3% salt, 0.3% yeast.


I don't remember where I got the recipe, I kind of obsessed with pizza last year and tried many recipes and this one gives the best crust and flavor for me. But I don't remember how to handle the dough after the cold fermentation in the fridge.


What I do is, mix the ingredients, knead just a little until it's not so sticky. After some rest I fold the dough and give it another rest, I repeat this a few times until the dough is smooth. The last time I divide and form the individual balls, put them in separated closed containers and put it in the fridge until the next day (usually 18-24 hours).


I take it out of the fridge about 8 hours before cooking them, but I don't remember if I should reshape the balls to strengthen the gluten (and then let them rest) before stretching and cooking them. Or should I just take it out of the fridge and not touch it until ready to stretch and cook?

Why did the apple skins turn blue/purple-ish in my apple pancakes the next day?,"Yesterday for dinner I made apple pancakes. I cut the apple into small pieces (with the skin on) and just put it into my pancakes batter. The skin was dark red. After cooking it, everything was looking fine.

It seems safe to eat, smell and taste are completely fine. I mean it's only been 1 single night after all.


So why did this happen?  

I've never heard of this. I've baked apple cake before (with skin) and it never turned blue-ish even after days.


The recipe I used includes flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, eggs, oat-almond milk, molten butter and 1 big apple.


After closer inspection it does look more grey-ish with dark purple-ish around the edges.  

Unfortunately I can't provide images as the pancakes are long gone.

It also has a [well-documented origin](https://taiken.co/single/the-origin-and-history-of-japanese-curry-rice/), having been introduced by British/Indian sailors during the period of British-Japanese naval alliance. This also includes an explanation for why Japanese curry uses a roux base (the navy wanted to add vitamin B1-bearing wheat to the sailor's diet). What it doesn't include is an explanation for when, how, and why the apples became a key ingredient.


Per [Chopstick Chronicles](https://www.chopstickchronicles.com/japanese-curry-rice/):



> 
> The ultimate Japanese curry rice secret ingredients “kakushi Aji”, which literally translates to “hidden taste”, are Apple and Honey. These are well-known Japanese curry rice ingredients among Japanese people so it’s not much of a secret anymore. Adding grated apple and honey gives the Japanese curry rice the signature sweeter flavour and is a staple for any Japanese mother’s home-cooked curry.

Apples are not used in Anglo-Indian curries that I've seen or been able to find online. So this leads to several related questions:


* Were apples added to standard Japanese curry when it was introduced to the 19th century navy?
* If so, were they added for nutritional reasons? Or were apples common in British curries of the time (the book ""Curry"" does not mention this, nor are apples mentioned in [Mrs Beeton's](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Mrs_Beeton%27s_Book_of_Household_Management.djvu/776))
* If the apples were added later, how did that come about? Was the [Vermont Curry company](https://housefoods-group.com/products/en/vmt/) responsible for it?

What would you call this way of cooking an egg?,"I recently discovered [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-0D_kL91PI) of Jaques Pepin frying a couple of eggs. I never really liked fried eggs before and I think this is because I'd been doing it wrong — with the heat too high. I've since been enjoying fried eggs quite a bit but I like the yolk slightly less runny. Usually where it's just a tad bit congealed but not hard.


I found a few places that outline the different names for fried eggs, which go something like this (from <https://www.eggs.ca/eggs101/view/7/how-to-fry-the-perfect-egg>):


* **Sunny side up**: The egg is fried with the yolk up and is not flipped.
* **Over easy**: The egg is flipped and the yolk is still runny.
* **Over medium**: The egg is flipped and the yolk is only slightly runny.
* **Over well**: The egg is flipped and the yolk is cooked hard.


The closest thing seems to be over medium but I'm not flipping the egg. So what would you call sunny side up with only slightly running yolk?

What's happens at temperatures in both the 'pasteurisation' and 'danger' zone?,"I am new to cooking and even newer to sous vide cooking. I have been trying to find as much information as I can with regards to cooking steak in the sous vide. One thing I am particularly confused by is certain temperatures in the 'danger' zone, between 40f-140f.


I have seen multiple youtube videos and articles stating not to go over a certain cooking time (usually 2.5h) in a sous vide when cooking under a certain temperature in the danger zone (usually 135f). The claim is for food safety reasons. However, I also found a document (by googling 'usda pasteurisation chart') for which it states that at 130f, for example, you can pasteurise or get a significant reduction in salmonella bacteria by cooking for about 2 hours.


I'm really confused by this as it seems to be that there are certain temperatures at which you can achieve 'pasteurisation', but which fall in the danger zone and so should apparently have way more bacteria and food safety concerns.

Usually, recipes have you add them in great enough numbers that you can't really just sift through and pull them out by hand. I saw a recommendation to stick them with toothpicks to make retrieval easier, but I'm not sure that would work with cloves (and I'd be worried about someone accidentally biting down on said toothpick).  

I've considered using powdered spices, but I'm not sure if it's the same flavor - and most recipes I've seen call for whole spices, not powdered.

Then I let them cool for a bit, and put them in the freezer. I prepare them from frozen in a pan (directly, no oil or steam beyond what they produce themselves).


Batch one went well, except that they don't keep their shape well. Between sous-vide and freezer, they end up in really odd shapes or even bent (presumably because I don't have a perfect spot).


Are there things I can add to the recipe, or to my technique, to help them stay a bit more flat and less thin? The main thing I've seen that I'm not including is bread/breadcrumbs; I'd prefer to not include that (as it's empty calories), but if this is the specific reason it's in there I could reconsider. I'm also using thighs, not breasts, in part as they have the fat profile I think is best - but if breast meat would do better in this application, I could certainly switch.

Can I make a sponge cake without sugar?,"I want to experiment with making a savoury sponge cake.

Why does the pineapple always ripen/soften from the base?,"As per [the consensus under this post](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/10101/do-pineapples-ripen-after-they-are-picked), lacking ethylene the pineapple softens but not ripens after picking. But it seems even before or right after picking the pineapple is ripe only at the bottom. Does it ripen from the bottom while on the plant because the base is connected to the stem? But why does that lead to the bottom ripening first?


Also my pineapples always ripen/soften from the bottom. It has become a pet peeve of mine that when the bottom is nice and soft and sweet, the upper 80% is still green and hard, but when the upper pineapple reaches the middle part of the softening process the bottom usually seems over-ripe, starting to rot. Why is that? I have seen posts here where people say they store their pineapples upside down. Is that necessary?

Cooking ground beef without the fat rendering off,"I like to cook ground beef by putting it in an oven safe dish and baking it at 350 Fahrenheit for 30 minutes. This works great for my purposes, but so much of the delicious fat is rendered to a liquid, e.g. there is a little island of beef in a pool of fat.


I would very much like to consume this fat rather than waste it. I do not fare very well directly eating the liquid/(semi-liquid after cooling) fat.


Can you think of any way to cook ground beef that does not result in rendering the fat? Maybe what I am asking for is impossible - if the ground beef needs to reach an internal temperature of 165, and fat starts to render at 135-140, ..

Blending pastry cream right after cooking: does it change final consistency?,"I prepared some pastry cream to use as pie filling.
Right after it had been cooked, and while still hot, I passed it through a sieve onto a bowl with chopped white chocolate.
As I tried to fold the chocolate onto the pastry cream, it would not melt properly, and pieces of it would remain in the cream even while I mixed.
I think next time I'll try and pre-melt the chocolate, at least partially, before incorporating.


Either way, and this was not part of the recipe, I decided to use the immersion blender to smooth out the cream and incorporate the stubborn white chocolate bits.
It worked for incorporating the chocolate, but I fear it may have worked *too* well for smoothing out the cream, and it became fairly liquid as it was blended.
It did become a little firmer as it cooled (to be expected, if only from the chocolate), but not enough so to be a satisfying pie filling.

Garlic substitution in marinade/paste,"I'm trying to find a substitute for garlic in a chicken pulao recipe. The masala paste calls for 4 cloves of garlic, which are ground with the other ingredients into a paste. I'm already substituting radish for the onion. (My sister has celiac disease and is very sensitive to/finds it difficult to digest onions and garlic and related -- no chives, shallots, etc. Even garlic and onion powder are out.)


I'm not sure what to substitute here. If it was a small quantity, such as one clove, I'd be ok in just omitting it entirely. But 4 cloves is not an insignificant amount. Further, [the canonical 'onion and garlic subsitutions' question](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/2596/substitute-for-onions-and-garlic) suggests a lot of other ingredients still in the garlic/onion family -- which are all out. Asafoetida, which it suggests, I've only ever used as an onion replacement. And even in that other question it says to fry it in hot oil first. My current use is as part of a paste which is used to marinate the meat overnight prior to cooking so I'm not not sure how having to fry it in hot oil first would work into that (assuming I can even find it in a store.)


I don't want to use ginger since the paste already includes ginger. Can I use horseradish? Garlic adds a certain kind of 'umami' and sharpness/pungency that I'm unsure how to replace in a marinade like this.


Basically the recipe is to grind a bunch of ingredients into a paste, coat the chicken, and let sit overnight. The coated chicken is then cooked with rice and spices to make the pulao. The other ingredients in the paste are onion, ginger, yoghurt or buttermilk, and spices.

After the second try, I did use just the flip-top bottles and closed the bottle tight. I opened the lids once a day since I was afraid of an explosion. Opening the bottle might have reduced the carbonation. It is adequate but could be a little more. Nevertheless, safety first.


From my experience, close the lid tight and leave it outside for about 24-48h. Leave it closed at your own risk.

How do I identify the fermentation process in a wild ferment?,"**TL;DR - How do I go about to identify the microbiological processes in a wild ferment?**


Background
----------


I have a recipe for rose hip wine based on wild (spontaneous) fermentation, that I got from a Swedish wine/beer makers forum. The recipe is simple (I've translated and summarized it a bit to make it fit better in the Q&A forum style). I've used the recipe above five times now with good results. The wine becomes very sweet and it has a quite low alcoholic content. It has a strong character of dried fruit and rose hips.


The recipe used
---------------


1. Take 2.5 liters of rose hips. Pick off bad parts but don't clean them with water or desinfect them in any way - make sure the wild microbes are kept!
2. Make a syrup of 3 liters (0.66 gal) water and 1.5 kg (2.2lbs) white sugar.
3. Add rose hips and syrup to a big ceramic jar with a plate as a lid (optionally use a proper fermentation lock). Let ferment like this for 3-6 months.
4. Strain and age on a carboy for 3 years. The taste is terrible initially, quite okay after 1 year, good after 2, excellent after 3.


This differ from most recipes online only on a few parts. (a) this is the only recipe with wild fermentation that I've found (b) the amount of water in other recipes is rather 7-10 liters for the same amount of hips and sugar (c) the first fermentation is 3-6 months instead of the typical 1-3 weeks seen in inocculated wine making (d) other recipes typically have some acid introduced in the beginning. lemons or lemon juince and possible lactic acid.


This is similar to other recipes online in the proportion of hips to sugar, and the recommendation to age 3 years is the same.


The current ferment
-------------------


This year is the first that I use a fermentation lock. I altered the recipe slightly by admitting oxygen freely the first week, stirring occasionally to get the ferment going. After that, I put the lock on.


The fermentation is slow, but carbon dioxide is released continously. A bubble every minute or so, and has now been going so for 3 weeks. The specific gravity is still very high, so there is sugars in abundance. The smell from the bubbles is a little yeasty. The smell is also a little sour, but not at all like vinager. This is the typical smell this ferment makes!


I've read online that rose hips are high in malic acid, so I guess the long aging is for malolactic fermentation to take place.


The question
============


I would like to know what fermentation is currently going. Is it yeast or LAB? Could there be other carbon dioxide releasing processes of significance?


This very slow fermentation indicates to me that there might be not enough nutrition to sustain a larger yeast population. It would be nice to do some kind of before/after test if I would ad nutrition to see what effect that has.


I have pH measurements and gravity measurements currently. I consider getting other equipment for up ca $200, such as a microscope.


How does one go about to analyze the fermentation process at this hobby level?

"Benefits or effects of salt on fruit fruit cleanliness with regards to wax, pests, pesticides, insecticides, etc?","There's a language barrier here for context.


I have heard from a family relative that they think using salt in the preparation of some fruits to be beneficial from a cleanliness perspective, which they heard from the radio. I inquired about the mechanics of how and why this works and did not receive any sort of explanation that satisfied me (e.g. Kenji J lopez style experiments or references to any scientific models/theories of why)


I understand that not all scientific models/theories work in all cases and some become historical as more cases and knowledge is discovered. However I do enjoy/prefer theories/models with experiments and tests with reproducible and measurable results to help prove things.


In all examples the salt used is normal table salt.


1. Preparing an apple to be eaten raw, putting salt on it first and rubbing. Then washing off the salt and washing like normal. Something about the salt is supposed to do something about insecticides and pesticides? I'm not sure if a case could be made for the salt being used as an abrasive for removing wax?
2. Grapes, Berries (blueberry, raspberry, strawberry) Rinsing them off with water like normal, then briefly soaking them in salt water, then dumping the salt water, then rinsing with water again. The salt water soak is supposed to do something for possible (insect) pests, pesticides, insecticides?


Let me know if these kinds of salt operations have any substantial effects good or bad, with regards to cleanliness, taste, nutritional etc. I have heard of brining meat, but never thought or heard of these kinds of practices.


I would be happy to see this debunked or explained.

"pickled cucumbers seemingly lasting ""forever""","My girlfriend's grandma has made pickled cucumbers for decades and distributed them to her whole family.


They are delicious, despite the jars looking like swamp water.


On one occasion, we got her some new jars and she later said that the older jars were better because they are not as tight as the new ones. Apparently they produce some gas and need to vent and I noticed that the sides of the jars show some dried liquid, so it is clear they all leak somewhat.


So, I'm wondering how can food which is not airtight and not refrigerated can last for months without spoiling? She's been doing that for 50+ years so somehow the technique works, but I'm curious about it.

Today I had the opportunity to question grandma about her method :)


She's 85 so she just knows what's she's always done :) the pickling is not using any heat, it's cucumbers, vinegar, salt, tons of spices and herbs.
she puts everything in jars that will 'gas out' and leak for a few days, and then after that another process seems to take place where the jar seals itself, doesn't leak anymore and becomes harder to open, so I guess the air inside is somehow consumed.

My first thought was to let the chocolate cool and thicken further before dipping; below 26C/80F. That did help to get a thicker coating, but reheating it from that point, after the temperature dropped too low, seemed to cause issues with the tempering of the chocolate.


Googling this, I found endless questions about how to achieve a thinner coating, but nothing about how to get a thicker one.


It seems possible to get an arbitrarily thick coating using a spherical mold, but marzipan can't really be piped into the sphere.


Is there a trick to getting a thicker layer when enrobing? Do I just need to be more patient with my approach of letting the chocolate cool, or do a better job of tempering it in the first place?

"What dough recipes are suitable for ""shaping"" with a piping bag?","I have made cookies based on [this recipe](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/chocolate-fudge-crinkle-biscuits), and we have really liked the taste. The appearance was not ok but not perfect, partly because my make-a-ball-and-flatten technique is not great (the outcome is not 100% round), but also because the dough started to stick to my hands 5 minutes after it was out of the fridge.


I wonder if it is possible/reasonable to ""shape"" these cookies using the piping bag, or maybe you would suggest another way to ""shape"" them nicely?


Is there a way to tell if the dough will be suitable for a piping bag ""shaping"", other than try-and-see-if-it-works method?

Why did my oatmeal and raisin cookies end up tasting soapy?,"I've made oatmeal cookies twice, and both times they have ended up tasting ""soapy"" and a touch bitter - the first time really strongly, the second less so, but still badly enough that I have to throw them away.


The details of the first attempt are lost to time, but the second time I used [this recipe](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/oatmeal-raisin-cookies). I think I followed it pretty accurately.


The only theories I have right now are:


* The bicarbonate of soda has a naturally soapy flavour (does it?), and I didn't fully finish cooking the cookies (I like them quite chewy - they definitely had a tan on top but probably could have had at least another 2-3 minutes in the oven before burning I suspect). But I baked them for around 15 minutes, more than the recipe anyway.
* The oats were a little old (the packet was probably about two months old), and maybe they'd gone bad? But they looked fine, and when I cooked some not that long ago for breakfast, they seemed fine.


Do either of these seem plausible, or is there another possible explanation?

What does the first icon mean?


It could be a part of the bechamel sauce recipe, but it misses everything else (the roux, etc.).


Am I supposed to boil 0.9L of milk, pour it in the flat bowl, then put the sauce (I cannot believe that, maybe a first layer of pasta on top of the milk? - still does not make a lot of sense) and then the layers of bechamel and sauce?


**In other words: where does this 0.9L of milk go?**


EDIT: on The French Barilla site they have a section with recipes, including a few lasagnas using the pasta I have. <https://www.barilla.com/fr-fr/recettes/collezione/lasagnes-a-la-sauce-napoletana-et-legumes-grilles> for instance mentions milk only in the context of the bechamel sauce.


**FINAL EDIT**: I got a message from Barilla telling me that the first icon is ""the recipe for bechamel""... Well never mind. I had the bolognese sauce done my own way and I used a 50 g flour + 50 g butter (roux), + 0,9L milk and the texture & amount was perfect. Thanks everyone.

But -- how ""different"" are the three grades of molasses (light, dark, and blackstrap) when they can be used **together** with sugar?


I understand light molasses have more sugar than dark or blackstrap. But does that simply mean that light molasses is exactly the same as ""white sugar + dark molasses"" ? And likewise, dark molasses is identical to ""white sugar + blackstrap molasses"" ?


I'm curious if I can simply just use blackstrap molasses only and just add however much white/refined sugar as needed (to balance out), rather than having to specifically use ""light"" or ""dark"" molasses (especially in things that might get blended, where everything is going to get very ""well-mixed"" anyway!).

The chicken has been already cooked. And is loveingly know as ""leftovers"". Good in the fridge for 4-5 days and in the freezer much longer. I was looking for a way to keep it moist while wanting to heat it and did not expect this other issue to develop in the process. All the directions on the internet say to check internal temperature for 165 degrees for an **already cooked** chicken. My logic tells me I don't have to heat it at all, it's already cooked I can just as easily make a cold chicken sandwhich with it.

Resting meat - room temperature and bacteria,"Many cooks/chefs recommend resting meat. There's a saying of ""rest for the same length of time it was cooked"".


For steaks this is fine, a 6 or so min cooking time means 6 mins at room temp is okay. But what about a full chicken or turkey? Depending on the size, they're cooked for 2-3 hours or more. Surely it's not safe to let those sit at room temperature for 2-3 hours?


It could rest at room temperature, for example, one hour, then the remaining time in the fridge, but this makes the meat cold, and in fact loses the ""freshly cooked"" essence to a degree.


So if you want to rest a chicken or turkey for the 3 hours of cooking time, must half of that be in the fridge to avoid bacteria growth? Or is there a better way than the fridge which seems to make chicken/turkey a little tougher after it's been cooled?

Grilling on an iron fire pit,"While walking home yesterday, I found a discarded fire pit (I initially thought it was a portable grill, but then then realized that it had only a mesh cover).


Some details:


* it's essentially an iron bowl with no bottom vents
* the lip is ~23"", including the outer rim. ~22"" excluding it
* the grate inside is ~11""


I would like to use this while spending as little money as possible. I assume the biggest downside versus an actual grill is that without a solid cover, I hit lower temperatures, and I'll lose some smoky flavor.


Some questions:


1. Should I get a wider grate that rests on the lip instead? Or can I get by with having a few coals that the small grate can rest on?
2. Should I try to find a solid grill cover instead of the mesh?
3. What would I miss out on if I don't have a cover?
4. Any other equipment I should have to avoid surprises?
5. Is it ok that I don't have any bottom vents? Unfortunately I sold my drill a while ago and don't have access to one right now.


Note that while I cook a lot, I grill very rarely and this will be the first time I grill without someone experienced with me - so I'm not looking to get into anything complicated right away; I'm hoping that this will help me practice some basics.

Why does my pizza dough (and other doughs) go sticky on freezing and defrosting?,"I make this [simple sourdough pizza dough](https://www.hobbshousebakery.co.uk/blogs/recipes/140061383-sourdough-pizza), with the slight variation that I weigh my starter. A half quantity does me 2 pizzas. So that's 150g 100% hydration starter, 125ml water, 250g flour, kneaded in a stand mixer and rested (30 minutes to 2 hours depending on my evening). That gives me a nice easy to work dough. But I only want to make one pizza, so I freeze half of the dough - I roll it into a ball, roll it in flour, and put it in a generously floured plastic container, then freeze for about a week.


When I defrost it (in the fridge for 24 hours), it's always stickier and harder to work with than it was before freezing, despite having added a little flour in the dusting. The resulting pizza is just as good though (fairly thin, baked at 240°C on a slab of preheated granite).


It happens consistently, and I've noticed the same with naan dough. The last 2 batches of pizza dough I froze with a note about how easy they were to handle, to be sure I hadn't just made a sticky batch and forgotten by the time I defrosted it.

Spread sauce on top (4). Bake at 350 F for 20-25 min - good luck!""


Before I go and waste a ton of ingredients trying to figure it out, is there a way I can find out what best process might fit for this?


1. What process should I use for the dough?
2. What thickness would be preferable for the rolls to bake properly without being raw in the middle in that time?
3. Do I really need to leave the rolls stuck together while baking, or should I keep them apart and let them expand into each other?
4. It seems like the sauce shouldn't go on top before baking, that would make them soggy, no?

Do you fold or blend the olives in a fougasse?,"As a variation from making focaccia with fried onions (impatience to spend 30 minutes frying onions, really), I experimented instead with sundried tomatoes.


[![focaccia in cast iron pan](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JKNAb.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JKNAb.png)


It's a success, although I needed to keep a very close eye after switching low-broil on (to get a more interesting crust and golden hue on top). The oil in the tomatoes makes them burn very quickly.


My next experiment is a sibling dish: olive fougasse, still in a 12"" cast iron pan to get a nice crust.


Here the recipes call for burying the olives **inside** the fougasse, not keeping them on top.


But it's unclear whether the olives should be blended in before the first/second rise, or folded into the dough after the first (second?) rise. Can you comment?


As you see from the picture above, the oily tomatoes weigh down the dough considerably, stopping it from rising quite as much as it would otherwise. Presumably the (equally oily) olives will
also inhibit excessive rising, although it may be that that's a characteristic of focaccia/fougasse.


**Clarification (update)**


A (good) pizza dough is not that different from the dough for focaccia or fougasse. Focaccia may have a bit more oil *within* the dough, but otherwise they're all similar.


Within that line of thinking, fougasse is an inherently easier dish to eat away from home (even in the car of someone who insists on absolute cleanliness inside, with no pieces of rosemary scattering around). Whatever would have made it as topping is simply burried inside the dough. The extreme is to *fold* the ingredients inside the dough. If the ingredients include tomato sauce, then the folding makes the dish become calzone—another dish that's particularly easy to take on trips.


Returning to the focus of the question: Is there any reason why you would want to fold the dough, possibly multiple times, to keep the olives out of the fabric/mesh of the dough? Or would you simply mix the olives in the dough (what I called earlier ""blend in"")? The nicest doughs result from two rises, not one. If you'd mix the olives, is there any reason why you'd mix them after, rather than before, the first rise?

Why is this croissant dough not behaving as expected?,"I followed [this video recipe](https://youtu.be/8zI-Q1MW_2o) for croissants, but whereas the video shows a soft, silky dough that proofs beautifully, I ended up with a dense, dry dough that has not risen appreciably after 90 min. I measured with a scale and proofed the dough in a warm environment, so I'm confident that neither of those is the problem. I did substitute dry yeast for fresh, but I also used yeast from the same package to make bread just the other day, so I'm confident that the yeast is healthy and active. What else could be going on?


1. Recipe
---------



> 
> * 500g flour
> * 70g sugar
> * 10g salt
> * 20g fresh yeast (which I converted to 8g dry yeast according to a website that claimed the correct multiplier is 0.4)

> 
> Combine dry ingredients; combine water, milk, & yeast; combine the two mixtures; knead in stand mixer 12 min.; proof until doubled in volume...

2. Further details
------------------


1. I did use a scale.
2. I have not verified the accuracy of the scale.
3. I proofed the dough in the oven, with the light on. I did not measure the temperature in there, but I'm going to say 30C/85F.
4. I proofed the dough for 90 min.

Does authentic Italian tiramisu contain large amounts of espresso?,"I see a lot of tiramisu recipes that soak savoiardi in pure undiluted espresso coffee.


Usually the recipe asks for a cup or more of espresso. As a person who regularly makes and drinks espresso, this seems way too much. It's both too much to prepare (8 shots!), and will make for an overpowering coffee flavor in the tiramisu.


I can understand if the recipes are adapted. Especially if the recipe asks for ""espresso or strong brewed coffee"", while no strong brewed coffee is a by-volume equivalent of espresso.


But, wouldn't original tiramisu recipes use espresso, but in some reasonable amount?
Or, is authentic tiramisu really so intensely flavored with coffee?

In terms of supporting information my skill level is home cook, quite happy making a huge mess in the kitchen to get a delicious meal for four together in about 2 hrs that gets compliments such as *that was better than I expected*.


As far as the recipe goes I boiled the potatoes until they were easily pierced by a knife, returned to the stove to evaporate moisture, used a potato ricer, added the butter (recipe called for one cup for a kilo of potatoes), seasoned and stirred it together. I went a bit off the recipe by simmering fresh cream and sliced truffle instead of using heavy cream as it was what I had to hand. The mashed potato tasted great and was properly cooked, nothing seemed wrong at this point.


I then produced the examples seen above in the second photo and placed these in the fridge overnight before expecting to put them in the oven (220 Celsius / 428 Fahrenheit, 20 mins) the next day and have them come out the same shape but cooked, this did not happen.


I've no idea what sort of potatoes I used but I did specifically say to the lady in the shop that these would be used for mashed potatoes (located in Spain if this has any bearing) and she told me which ones were best. As such I'm pretty sure I didn't use the wrong potatoes and didn't miss any ingredients that would naturally explain why the potatoes melted down to a thin layer (baking soda [probably not], yeast [never heard of yeast in mashed potato]) I'm pretty sure I've made an error so rookie it just doesn't occur to me.


I would like to know why the potatoes became completely flat and how to prevent this in the future please.




---


Here is the recipe I followed as suggested in the comments:


**1 Boil the potatoes:** Place potatoes in a medium to large pot (3 qt) and cover with a couple inches of cold water. Add a couple teaspoons of salt to the water. Bring to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are tender (the tines of a fork easily pierce), about 20-25 minutes.


*Did this*


**2 Melt butter, preheat oven:** While the potatoes are boiling, melt 2 tablespoons of butter and set aside. You will use this butter to coat the potatoes right before they go in the oven. Preheat the oven to 425°.


*Didn't do this, I brushed with olive oil, cold the next morning*


**3 Drain potatoes and let them release steam:** When the potatoes are cooked, drain in a colander and put the potatoes back in the pot set over low heat. Allow them to release steam for a minute or so.


*Did this but right after the potatoes were boiled*


**4 Mash with butter**, then with spices and cream, then with salt and egg yolks: Add 2 tablespoons of butter and mash the potatoes until the butter has been incorporated. Add the nutmeg, black pepper, heavy cream and continue mashing the potatoes.


*Didn't do this at all, instead I simmered sliced truffle and fresh cream for about 20 mins and stirred it in to the mash*


**5 Pipe onto a baking sheet, brush with melted butter:** Using a piping bag with a large star point, pipe the potatoes onto a cookie sheet. Alternatively, you can just fill a casserole dish with the mashed potatoes, and use a fork to create lots of peaks on the surface.


*Did this but used olive oil, not melted butter, piping nozzle was very small (8mm, star shape)*


**6 Bake:** Bake in the 425°F oven until nicely browned, about 20 minutes.


*Did this after leaving the finished piped potatoes in an oven dish in the fridge wrapped in cling film overnight*

Vegan crepes that don't fall apart when turning,"When I make [crepes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%AApe) I use eggs, flour and milk for the dough and tiny amount of oil for the pan.

Replacing milk with various liquids (soy milk, almond milk...) seems to work fine.

Cooking Tasks for Children,"One of the positive things about lockdown has been cooking more with my children (6 and 9). They enjoy the obvious tasks to give them peeling & washing veg, grating, picking leaves of herbs, and stirring saucepans. I’m pretty safety conscious so while they sometimes chop things these are only things that can be chopped with a table knife, like mushrooms. They also enjoy opening packets, etc. I like them doing these tasks as it can be a genuine help as they prefer that to invented jobs. But, these tasks unfortunately all tend to be clustered at the beginning of most recipes and I’d like to find things for them to do. But, I want to keep them away from boiling water, hot fat, chefs’ knives, and the inside of the oven until they are a bit older.


I’d love suggestions of other things they can do so they don’t wander off disillusioned. Equally, I’d be super grateful for suggestions of recipes where they can contribute throughout. Or if there is equipment or other ways to make other activities safer that would also be great. I’m not terribly interested in baking type things which we already do.

Why is beef butchered in small scale almost subsistence farming so tough that even tenderloin is only good for ground beef?,"I just bought a whole beef tenderloin on a wet market in a small rural place in a developing country in Asia. I noticed something is wrong with it regarding tenderness from the first moment I touched it with a knife. It felt tough, way too tough. I only know its a tenderloin because I bought it whole, and it looks like a tenderloin, though its quite big (3 kg). I've cut a steak from it, and tried searing it on hot butter for a minute or two, very rare. I've cut a piece, and when I put it in my mouth, its like the toughest cut of beef. Its so tough, its not even edible in any other way then grinding. I tried cutting more steaks and cooking them a bit longer, on less and more heat, and the results are even worse. Had to make a stew out of it in the end. I am very surprised a tenderloin can even be so tough, I thought no matter how bad the cow is, you can make a somewhat edible steak out of a tenderloin. I was wrong.


My question is what causes it to be so tough?


Was it something in the way the beef was raised? It's a very small rural place, here they butcher about one cow a week usually, and they come from the local population where it is common for a family to keep a single cow, and slaughter it after a year or two, take some meat for themselves and offer the surplus for sale.


Cows are probably 100% grass-fed, or rather fed whatever the cow can find roaming around the village. People are very poor and they don't feed them grains, cereals even if they would want to, because they can't afford to buy any feed.


Is it about the way its butchered? Butchering process is very basic, no stunning, they just cut the throat of a fully conscious animal. There is no ageing of any kind, no hanging for a few days, as there are no facilities for that. There is even no refrigeration available. Cows are butchered around 2-3 AM, and the surplus meat is sold at 6-8 AM the same day.


Surprisingly, the tenderloin is not more expensive then other cuts of the cow, which means it's likely not in very high demand. The price the same for almost any cut of beef, equivalent to about 6 USD/kg (3 USD/lb). Interestingly price for beef shank with bone is 5 USD/kg, so the tenderloin is only 20% more expensive then the shank. Most local people who buy the beef from this rural source, probably don't even know what a steak is or own a pan. For them 1 kilo of beef is 1 kilo of beef, doesn't matter much which cut. They usually just put it all in a stockpot anyway, it makes no difference if its tenderloin or shank - this is my impression from talking to the local population.


In the same country, a tenderloin from a big city supermarket (where beef comes from completely different sources, more large scale commercial operations and professional abattoirs), is tender as any tenderloin normally is, and costs about 20 USD/kg.


This is not the first time I experience unusually tough beef from very-small scale farmers. A few years back I was living in a developing country in Eastern Europe and several times got into a cow-share buying part of a cow butchered in a similarly basic operations, outside of the normal commercial distribution channels, and the beef was also unbelievably tough. I didn't get the tenderloin there, but for example got meat from entrecôte (rib-eye), and also the only thing that could be done with it was to grind it, trying to fry it ended up inedible.


I don't think its because of being 100% grass-fed, as I bought some 100% beef from a bit larger, medium-scale farmer in western Europe, who has maybe 50 cows and hangs them after butchering and the meat was as tender as most beef. I know grass-fed beef doesn't have much marbling, so some cuts won't give as good steaks because of lack of fat, but for the tenderloin there should be no difference as there isn't any marbling anyway.


Also I don't think its because of the breed, as the super-tough beef from small-scale farmer in Eastern Europe was Salers which is a well known quality cattle breed, and the farmer was even certified organic.


In both the Asian and Eastern European country, any beef from a supermarket is reasonably tender, only when I buy beef from very small scale operations, its so tough. Does non-professional butchering, not in a abattoir, without hanging the carcass to age a little, is the reason the meat ends up so tough that even the tenderloin is only good to mince for ground beef, and you can't make an edible steak out of anything from the cow? Or is there another major reason for the toughness? I know many factors have some impact on tenderness, like the cow's breed, diet, but I I want to what is most likely the major factor in the situation described above, which make the beef tough even if everything else is done right?

I am updating my skill level from *home cook* to *bad* after the last post.


I am planning to cook these tomorrow but only have one oven that will be slow cooking / braising beef short ribs which will be set to 135 Centigrade or 275 Fahrenheit from approximately 0900 to 1400, aiming to have 14 served by 1410 and I can't change the temperature as the meat is the main part of the meal.


How can I cook the Duchess potatoes when I can't change the temperature of the oven and the recipe says to do them at 220 Celsius or 430 Fahrenheit for 20 mins to be served immediately?


Options I've thought of are:


* Put them in with the meat for longer and accept they will take longer. *This is my preferred option but when I reached out to family the response was that they may not brown correctly. It was suggested this could be corrected under the grill right at the end when the meat is removed and being served*
* Cook them at the proper temperature for the full time before the meat to achieve the browning and let them stand for four hours before returning them to the oven to warm them up again at the meat temperature.
* Cook the meat and then turn the oven up at the end to cook the Duchess potatoes to their recipe (20 mins at 220C or 430F) while the meat stands, maybe returning it to the oven just before serving if the temperature drops.
* Cook the Duchess Potatoes before and reheat in the microwave while serving the meat


I'd like to know if any of the options above are *the correct approach* or *definitely not going to work* or if there's an option I haven't thought of yet that's a better way.

Should I hand wash my wok by adding water to it every time? After I am done using the wok, I wash it with water. Then, I heat up the pan to get the water off it to prevent rusting. Then, I add oil to it.


I feel adding water to it might hinder the seasoning process and is an unnecessary step. What do you wok experts suggest I do?

Why does rye flour dough require more water?,"Most discussions I have seen on the internet recommend increasing water content when substituting wheat flour with rye flour.


I find this a bit puzzling since I always thought that hydration of the dough should be based on the protein content - more gluten means stronger dough, which means it stretches without tearing even at higher hydration.


Rye flour (at least the one I have) is very high in carbohydrates but low in protein content, so why is more water required?

Salted cod should last much longer than that, what got me worried is when after re-hydrating and desalinating the remaining pieces in water (about 48 hours). I saw the outside of the fish became light-brown instead of white.

Safe to cook with alcohol,"I want to cook with wine as the [recipe](https://www.chewoutloud.com/tuscan-style-beef-stew/) I want to make calls for it. However I cannot have any alcohol in me because I have to drive and my country calls for a 0 BAC.


The recipe uses 750ml of wine, 1 cup of water and no other significant source of fluid. Most of the cooking time the dish is supposed to be covered tightly to reduce boil-off and around 250ml of the wine is only added 10 minutes before the end.


Will all of the alcohol evaporate in the 2 hours it simmers for? Or is there an alternative to using Chianti.


Recipe:


**Ingredients**


* 3 to 3 1/2 lbs boneless chuck roast, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces
* 2 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 1 TB olive oil
* 1 bottle (750ml) Chianti
* 1 cup water
* 1 onion, thinly sliced
* 3 carrots, peeled and sliced into 1/2-inch thick rounds
* 3 stalks celery, sliced into 1/2-inch pieces
* 10 cloves garlic, chopped
* 4 sprigs fresh rosemary
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
* 1 TB unflavored gelatin powder (I use Knox brand)
* 1 TB tomato paste
* 1 tsp anchovy paste (don’t skip this)
* 2 tsp cornstarch


**Steps**


1. Pat dry cut-up beef well, using paper towels.Toss beef with salt in a bowl and let stand at room temp 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350F with rack on lower middle position.
2. In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium high heat until starts smoking. Add half of the beef in a single layer and cook until well browned on all sides, about 8 min total, reducing heat if it begins to burn.
3. Stir in 2 cups wine, water, onion, carrots, garlic, rosemary, bay leaves, pepper, gelatin powder, tomato paste, anchovy paste, and all remaining beef. Bring to a boil and immediately reduce to simmer. Cover tightly with foil, followed by lid (helps retain moisture.) Transfer to hot oven and cook until beef is tender, about 2 hours.
4. In a bowl, whisk the remaining wine with the cornstarch until dissolved. Add to the pot of braised beef. Place pot on stovetop and bring to a boil over medium high heat; immediately reduce to simmer. Simmer (low boil) uncovered, stirring,10 minutes. Should be somewhat thickened. Season with additional kosher salt and pepper to taste, if needed.
5. Serve with crusty bread, rice, noodles, or potatoes.

When can you NOT replace milk with almond milk?,"I saw a video on making pizza and it seemed easy enough, but the recipe required milk to make the dough.

This somewhat complex recipe has yielded amazing looking and tasting breads. I am aware that this much work is not required but I like doing it. I also do not adhere to the times perfectly as sometimes less and sometimes more time is required to get the dough to the right point.
I am scoring the bread once down the middle about a centimeter deep (about a third of an inch) sometimes deeper sometimes shallower. The end result is the same.


What is happening in the oven is the following:
The bread starts to rise but as it does so, the crust is already forming strings(water vapor present or not) and prevents the crust from breaking open where I slashed it. The end result tastes perfect, but has humongous holes at the top, where it was supposed to rip open.


I have these pictures of today's baking run:

[![Crumb View](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ACoR9.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ACoR9.jpg)


The darker loaf (the right one) has been baked without being sprayed with water first.


As you can see, the crumb is nice, up to where is becomes moon craters. The tops have been slashed but not ripped open as they are expected to. Can anyone give me some advice on how to achieve this again? In my dutch oven it worked well almost every time. I cannot use that anymore though because the oven I have at the moment does not reach the temperature I need as I said before.


TL;DR
I have made good dough with very good oven spring. I have slashed my loaves but cannot get an open crust.

What did European/American historical cooks do with the egg whites?,"I do some historical cooking out of old cookbooks, like Amelia Simmons' *[American Cookery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cookery)* or *[The Art Of Cookery Made Plain and Easy](https://archive.org/details/TheArtOfCookery)*. One thing I've noticed is that these cookbooks use *way* more egg yolks than whites. For example, I prepared an 18th century feast one night and ended up with 10 leftover egg whites in a jar.


This left me wondering, what did they do with the egg whites? Given the extreme frugality of cooks centuries ago, which included using every scrap of stale bread and every bit of a pig including the oink, I find it impossible to believe that they were wasted. They must have used them for something ... but that's not in the recipes I have. So, questions:


1. Are the cookbooks we have simply not representative of actual cookery of the 15th-18th century? That is, are they purely posh cookery and as a result did actually waste the egg whites?
2. Or were the egg whites used for some other purpose that required a lot of whites, maybe even a non-culinary purpose?


Help me solve this mystery. Thanks!

Once the fish is dredged in flour and coated in batter from the soda cannister, he fries it. For one last step to make the batter crispy and thick, he drizzles more of it onto the fish while it’s in the frying oil.

Why cook octopus with an onion?,"I've been following all the rule books on how to cook fresh/thawed octopus, specifically to ""frighten"" the octopus before cooking.

UK Pork roast: why can't I make crisp crackling?,"I have lived in Denmark for many years and made port roast many times with crisp crackling - never a problem. Then I moved to UK about 20 years ago, and now I just can't. I first tried buying in the supermarket, then I went to butchers, and I even ordered specific cuts, that are not usually sold in UK; every time the result was semi-dry meat and rubbery skin.


Recently, I tried a piece of pork from a Chinese supermarket: perfect crackling, just like that, and I have tried it several times. The question is, why? Is there something that is done to pork meat only in UK that could explain this?


***Edit***


To address the comment from Sneftel:


Cooking pork roast has always been very straight-forward - the method that always worked in Denmark (and now with the pork from the Chinese supermarket) is:


1. take a roasting tray with a griddle, fill the bottom with water.
2. put meat on top, skin side up.
3. roast in a conventional oven at 150 - 200 degrees (Celsius) for about an hour, until the skin bubbles up everywhere and is nice and crisp.


When I tried this with British pork from a supermarket, the end result is something about as crisp as my old wellies.

"If cooking doesn't kill all the nutrients in tomatoes, why are none in sauce labels, even the nice ones made direct by an organic farm?","I've had this question in my head since forever, it's kind of a food sciencey question. I understand that cooking changes the properties of food including their nutritional value, sometimes positively, sometimes negatively. It appears per this link (<https://healthyeating.sfgate.com/health-benefits-eating-cooked-tomato-products-4444.html>) that cooking does not affect Vitamin C and lycopene (but it does affect Vitamin A).


But every time I go to buy a tomato sauce (see important note below\*\*\*), the nutritional label shows literally no vitamins, why? Is it a labeling problem? Like lycopene doesn't show up on labels. Maybe Vitamin C becomes some new form that's not label-able?? Or is it that cooking doesn't kill vitamins but the high pressure canning process does? (implying that if I make homemade tomato sauce, I won't have this problem)


My motivation for this is that I like healthy eating and am just trying to understand how to healthily consume tomatoes.


\*\*\***A note on the tomato sauce I'm talking about**


*I'm talking specifically about the kinds of tomato sauce that vendors at farmer's markets make using their own products. I can't speak for all farms, but having worked at one that did sell our products, I know exactly how this gets made. We harvest tomatoes, we cook & process everything in our own kitchen, we hire a contracted nutritionist to analyze the product & write the label, then we print the label and off it goes. Like, the process is basically exactly like a home cook's. It's not over-processed, over-salted like some industrial makers' products would be. I imagine this process is similar for some other local, premium organic brands that you find at small grocers (except they don't grow their own tomatoes). So given this is so similar to a home cook's process, why are there no nutritional points?
I know what you're thinking... yes I am an idiot that I didn't think to ask our nutritionist this question. But I didn't and now I don't have a person to talk to.*

* strain through sieve into siphon to make sure no undissolved pieces of chocolate get into siphon

You might say that’s normal but if I get raw chicken and then cook it the whole thing always feels tastefully hot inside and out.


Canned chicken(cooked or not) always seems to have a mushy texture unlike raw chicken. Do you know why and why does it feel like cooking still leaves the inside quite cold compared to other cooking methods. As you can see from pic, Even visibly the outside might become dark and crusty but the inside still looks very pinkish though I know these are precooked.

What are the limitations of aquafaba as an egg white substitute?,"I learned recently that aquafaba is claimed to be usable as an egg white substitute, able to be whipped to form stiff peaks, etc.


Now an egg-white-and-cottage-cheese omelette is a frequent breakfast of mine. So it was with great experimental enthusiasm that I mixed up some aquafaba with cottage cheese, and set about cooking it as usual...only to end up with aquafaba and cottage cheese soup. :(


What is a more realistic assessment of where aquafaba can be substituted for egg whites? Or is there possibly some modification that would make an aquafaba-and-cottage-cheese omelette possible?

Should a gas Aga be left on when not in use?,"We've recently moved into a house with an Aga GC3 cooker; though have no experience with this type of oven. Reading up on Agas, people talk about them being left on all the time; though this seems like a waste of gas for our usage (1 cooked meal each evening; unused the rest of the day). When people say they can be left on all of the time I'm not sure if they're envisaging scenarios where the Aga is an old solid-fuel style (where this would have been far more practical), or cooks who are baking throughout the day, or making use of the waste heat for drying their wellies and wet dogs.


We've found that it takes about 2 hours to get up to the required temperature for cooking; so if not left on all the time requires a lot more planning than the gas hobs we're used to; but leaving it on feels wasteful.


Is it best (in terms of efficiency / our described usage pattern) to leave an Aga on full time (e.g. is it more efficient to keep it at temperature than to have to bring it up to temperature each day), and if left on, when not in use is it best to keep it on the Full setting, or to put it to Low Heat or Pilot Light mode?

Reason(s) for poor bread results,"This past weekend I was fortunate enough to be gifted a standing mixer.


My first project was James Beard's white bread. The end characteristics that I wish to improve on were:


* When attempting to de-loaf the bread to tap the bottom, the top crust was hermetically sealed onto the loaf pan
* It smelled yeasty instead of a nice baked smell. It didn't necessarily taste as yeasty as it smelled
* It was very, very dense


Some thoughts on why it had these issues:


* I was advised to mix for 5-10 minutes. I mixed for a solid 10 minutes
* For the 2nd proofing, I was advised to go 40-60 minutes. I barely went 40
* During mixing, toward the start, I didn't feel I had the best we/dry mixture. I played around a bit with the water and flour. When I took it out to place it in the bowl for the 1st proofing, the dough was very sticky

Timing Stock/Broth Perfectly,"I have been experimenting with different methods and I am trying to find the perfect extraction time for each of the elements of my stock. I first noticed this when one time I added celery leaves and parsley in the last hour of the cook, and it had such a nice fresh aroma to compliment the deep stock flavour and thought maybe it would make sense to add in every element of a stock at different times?


It's been my experience that Chicken Carcass and Feet are about done at around 4-6 hours, Veal and Beef Bone around 10-12. But vegetables are good after about 2 hours (carrots, celery, leek), is there any reason why I should not cook my veal stock for 8 hours and then right towards the end pop in the vegetable? It seems so intuitive for me but I have literally NEVER seen it done. Maybe I'm missing something?

Does the foam from instant coffee always taste bitter?,"I'm trying instant coffee for the first time and thought that it tasted like drinking a flat tire.

Re-seasoning of cast iron skillet gone wrong?,"So, we had some stir-fry burn up pretty badly in our trusted cast-iron skillet. Upon cleaning the skillet some of the coating came off with the burned food. I made a first attempt of re-seasoning it with avocado oil and putting it upside down in the oven for an hour at 375°F. The result was mediocre, there was some coating in the stripped areas but it didn't look like the rest of the surface, and you could see some bare metal shining through. Sure enough, food was sticking again to the stripped area.


My wife re-seasoned it again, this time following slightly different instructions that were on the internet: using olive oil and baking it for two hours right-side-up at 450°F. At the end of the process the skillet definitely had a new hard coating that was smooth and not sticky to the touch. However, there was an anomaly in the middle (probably around the same spot that got stripped originally, but we can't be sure). There was a raised ridge around the area, but the area inside the ridge still did appear to have a proper coating:


[![Unusual ridge near the center of the skillet](https://i.stack.imgur.com/32b1N.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/32b1N.jpg)

Now, ""do not refreeze"" is straightforward. We were taught in grade school, don't re-freeze meat or food poisoning can result.


Does ""must remove from packaging before thawing"" have a similarly health-oriented cause? Or is it simply less damaging to the filet to remove it from vacuum-packing while it's frozen? This advice is contrary to the simplicity and neatness of thawing the fish while it's still vacuum-packed.

Reasons my sourdough attempts failed?,"Last March I started adventuring into the world of Sourdoughs by following the advise of [The Fresh Loaf Bakers's handbook](https://www.thefreshloaf.com/handbook) but using wholegrain rye flour all the way and it went pretty well; after a week or so I started having nice sour rye breads. For context, this was a typical spring in Mallorca, known for its usual high humidity, with temperatures at home between 18-20ºC to about 30ºC by the time I left.


Then, I moved to Vigo (northwestern Spain) in the middle of July and sure shortly after I decided to make a new sourdough from scratch following the same recipe, but this time no orange juice.


For context, I set up a humidity/temperature sensor and got some values ranging 70% and 99% (crazy weather here) and intense 29-32ºC at home. The result was a rather smelly (and not in a good sense, nowhere similar to what I had before) sourdough after a few days, which after four or five days developed a thin white layer of something I thought would be mold.


I had searched for this at the time and found it might be mold, so I discarded it. Then I said to myself, it must be the orange juice, so I went and tried again with orange juice only to obtain the same results. This experimentation process went for about 4 cycles.


I tried feeding it twice a day, I changed the jar in which I was keeping it, I covered the jar, I uncovered the jar, I sealed the jar, all to no avail. By then I decided not to waste more time and wait for colder climate maybe (haven't done so yet, though).


Now I'm thinking I want to start again, but I'd like to get some feedback from more experienced users into what might had gone wrong. I even started to suspect it was related to the quality of water (which I purify with one of this Britta filters, any thoughts?) or of the air.

How to open a malfunctioning tamper-proof bottle cap?,"I have a bottle of oil I want to open. It is a glass bottle with a threaded metal cap. It is the type of cap which is connected in a few places to a lower ring. Usually, one just unscrews the cap, and it tears off the ring, which stays below the threads.


I now have a bottle whose cap+ring system is too loose. When I turn the cap, the whole thing, cap+ring, rotates freely without unscrewing or exerting a tearing force on the connection places.


What I tried, unsuccessfully:


* turn it vigorously
* grip it with a towel while turning
* exert an upward pull while turning it
* holding the lower ring with the fingers of one hand while gripping the cap with the fingers of the other hand through a towel, and exerting force in opposite directions
* trying to cut the connection places with a knife tip (doesn't get cut, but it feels like the knife might slip and hurt me any time).


Note that this is a different problem than the much more common one of both not turning and my fingers slipping on the cap instead. I can grip the cap perfectly well, and it rotates very easily, it just doesn't unscrew or separate from the ring.

I found [this thread](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/32291/why-are-there-no-recipes-combining-both-yeast-and-baking-powder), from which I basically concluded that there is no real leavening effect of using baking powder and yeast together because if you bake it quickly, the yeast fails to leaven as it does not have time to work, and if you bake it after resting, the baking powder would fail to leaven because it is already spent by the time baking starts.

How to make a meringue cake layer that is not cracked?,"I have been trying for some time to make a meringue cake layer (like for Pavlova, but flatter, thinner) and I have not had any luck.


The recipe I use is 50 grams of sugar per one medium egg white, and 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar if using 3 egg whites.


So I use 150 grams of sugar, 3 medium egg whites, and 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar. (I stopped adding flavourings because I think they might contribute to my failure.)


I use glass or metal bowl that has been washed, dried, and lightly wiped down with a lemon sliced in half. The mixer beaters are also washed and wiped with lemon juice. The egg whites are at room temperature when I start mixing.


How I make it - I use a hand-held electric mixer and beat the egg whites (oh high speed) until somewhat stiff peaks form, and then I start adding in the sugar, a spoonful at a time, beating well between each addition (15-20 seconds on high speed) until it becomes almost shiny.


I draw four circles on the baking paper (15 cm in diametre), divide and spread out the egg whites with a spoon, and put it immediately in the oven at 100C (212F), for 60 minutes, then I turn off the oven, leave them in for 15 minutes more, and take out.


I have tried baking (drying, essentially) them at 90C, at 120C, all with varying results, but they almost always come out cracked and not white.

What is a stem pan?,"I have a vintage cookbook, from Charlotte, North Carolina and about 1958, that has a recipe for “Different Applesauce Cake”. It says to “Cook in stem pan approximately 1 hour, 10 minutes”.


Searches for “stem pan” brings up pan definition lists that don’t include “stem pan”; searches for “stem pan baking” brings up a lot of pages on how to teach STEM using baking. There is [one patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/DE102009052528B4/en) that appears at first to be about stem pans, but on reading seems to be about stems on pans. Though it could be that stem pan is another word for skillet.


In all cases, search engines like to replace “stem” with “steam”. There does appear to be something called a “steam pan”, but it appears to be the kind of pan used by buffet restaurants to keep food warm, not something for baking.


Searches on “stem pan” with “apple cake” do bring up some variations on some odd sites; but they don’t explain what it is. Some recipes use a variation of “[use a loaf pan or a stem pan](https://www.cooks.com/recipe/sz0al5ev/apple-sauce-cake.html)” and others a variation of “[use a bundt pan or a stem pan](https://mc6help.tripod.com/RecipeLibrary/Cakes.txt)”. Some suggest [using it ungreased](http://kora.matrix.msu.edu/files/121/712/79-2C8-A10-45-msuspcsbs_ligh_burrusmill2.pdf), some [greasing and flouring the pan](https://tarltonapps.law.utexas.edu/exhibits/law_wives/dishes.pdf), others [lining the bottom with greased paper](http://www.recipesit.com/recipes/304359-one-egg-cake.html), which seems a bit difficult if it’s just another word for bundt pan, or even if it’s another term for “tube pan” which is what I most suspect.


On the idea that this might be a dialect around Mississippi and North Carolina, I tried a search for “stem pan” and “southern” and found two contradictory recipe pages with images of the pan in question. A [recipe for corn bread](https://www.farmflavor.com/recipes/old-fashioned-corn-light-bread/) that has a photo of the corn bread in a skillet; this may be a stock photo, however. And a recipe for [tomato soup cake](https://twoluckyspoons.com/foodbuzz-242424-great-depression-cooking-for-the-recession-cook/) that has a photo of it being poured into what looks like a bundt pan. So it may be that this is a term that applies to multiple items.


I did image searches for various forms of “cake pan advertisement”, such as “mirro bakeware advertisement” and “old bakeware advertisement”. I found several for tube pans and bundt pans and none advertising stem pans.


I did a search specifically for the phrase “stem pan” limited to the site archive.org; the term appears to be exclusively found in older organizational cookbooks (five church organizations, one library association, one high school club, and one college club). They range from 1911 to 1982 except for two: [one from 1991](https://archive.org/details/recipesofyesterd00firs/page/32/mode/2up?q=stem%20pan), but it’s the submitter’s grandmother’s recipe, and [one from 2006](https://archive.org/details/feedingflockstlu00stlu/page/105/mode/2up?q=stem%20pan), but it’s a reprint from the organization’s 1981 cookbook. (Of course, also, since it’s archive.org it’s likely to be weighted toward older books.)


There are no photos, as is normal for such cookbooks. There are no definitions, either, although there is [one parenthetical](https://archive.org/details/heavenlydelights00wesl/page/244/mode/2up?q=stem%20pan): “Bake in greased and floured stem pan (I use cast iron bundt pan)” which could of course be read either as an example or an alternative. One intriguing set of directions ends, for [Texas Pecan Cake](https://archive.org/details/NationalHighSchoolRodeoAssociation/page/n45/mode/2up?q=stem%20pan), with “Bake in stem pan 10x4 inches”. I suspect that this means a 10-inch diameter, 4-inch deep pan, especially given the quantity of ingredients; it’s an odd direction, though, because by that point the batter has already been poured into “a well-greased tube pan”. However, it matches something I saw in The Joy of Cooking while trying to look up the term, that a 9-½ by 4-¼-inch plain tube (angel cake pan) is “Conventionally described as 10x4-inch plain tube” (p. 701 in my 2006 copy).


* [Recipes of Yesterday and Today](https://archive.org/details/recipesofyesterd00firs/page/32/mode/2up?q=stem%20pan) (1991)

What is a stem pan? A skillet? A bundt pan? A tube pan? A loaf pan? A variation? Or something else? Or more than one item? I am at this point almost certain that it is either a tube pan (most likely), or a variation on a tube pan, but the lack of any definition or photo keeps me from knowing for sure what variation, if any, the term might mean.

Freezing prepared dry salted fish,"How does prepared dried-&-salted fish hold in the freezer?


The fish has been (properly) desalted, and, other than that, the recipe contains tomato (boiled down to a paste), tomato puree, onion, garlic and madame jeanette. There's tons of minor twists, but mostly it boils (haha) down to that.


I'm not worried if it's safe, I'm mostly wondering how it will keep texture wise.


The whole thing can (in general) be prepared in about two hours (including desalting), but I'm wondering if it's worth making it in bigger batches and freezing it. Desalting the fish produces quite a powerful smell, but refrying small batches of the prepared doesn't (as much). And while I don't mind the smell at all, my better half does ;)


**Edit:**


The salted fish is cod, and the fish has been desalted before cooking it with rest. The idea was to freeze the whole thing, but it's actually just as interesting to know if just the desalted cod will freeze nicely.

Letting batter with baking soda wait before adding into the oven,"I want to bake a cake with 3 layers, but I only have one baking pan and thus I will have to bake them one by one (already thought about making one big cake and dividing it into 3 parts but I pref not to use that method).


The problem is it takes 35 minutes to bake one layer and the batter contains baking soda and baking powder and I'm worried it will affect the outcome since I'm not baking the other 2 layers immediately after adding the baking soda.


So my question is, can I let the batter for the other 2 layers wait before adding to the oven?


Making the batter and separating into 3 and then adding the baking soda and powder isn't an option since I would have to mix it again which will affect the result. And I also don't want to make the batter for each layer separately.

Verdigris on copper-bottomed pan,"I have a small stainless steel pan with a copper bottom. The diameter is around 4in or 10cm, so it is really small. I use it exclusively for [tempering](https://www.npr.org/2011/12/07/143251451/the-crackling-spices-of-indian-tempering) or what is known in India as *tadka*. That is, I heat a couple of spoonfuls of ghee, add the necessary spices (mustard seeds, cumin seeds, curry leaves, chili peppers, asafœtida, whatever the recipe calls for), then add the tempering to the main dish, usually lentils or a stew.


Since the pan is tiny, my usual method of adding the tempering is just to dunk the entire pan into the larger pan that has the main dish. Then I scoop up some of the main dish with the smaller pan, swirl it around to gather any fat or spices left in the pan, and pour this back into the main dish, repeating the process a couple of times.


The last time I tried this (a couple days ago), I was horrified to notice that the copper bottom of the pan was beginning to develop verdigris. Here is a picture:


[![copper bottom of pan with trace of verdigris](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dablg.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dablg.jpg)


I'm obviously concerned about this. I have three questions:


* Should I give up the habit of dunking this little pan into the larger pan? Will the verdigris get into the food and make it dangerous to eat?
* Is there any way I can get the verdigris off the bottom of the pan?
* Assuming there is, what can I do to prevent a recurrence? For example, I usually put this pan in the dishwasher. Should I be washing it by hand instead?

"Simmering, rather than caramelizing, onions (plus garlic and ginger)","I can caramelize onions, garlic, and ginger over 30 minutes, stir frying.


But this requires me to stand in front of the stove for 30 minutes. Instead, I prefer to spend 90 minutes, adding a bit of water and a touch of oil, then letting them simmer, with the onions taking half the time alone before the others are added. I can then do something else during that time.


[![ultra slow caramelization of onions](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rf6ef.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rf6ef.jpg)


Does this process have a name? Does it still qualify as caramelization? Would a self-respecting chef do this once a week with larger quantities and freeze small containers with the mixture for use throughout the week?


**Update**


I say the following only half in jest. Since Tetsujin slapped the entirely derogatory ""fairgrounds"" term on boiled-down onions, I'm wondering whether I can elevate this method ever so slightly by giving it another term, and a French one at that.


Isn't boiling down onions exactly how you make French onion soup?


**Update 2**


Correction to self: as pointed out by Preston in the comments, French onion soup is caramelized onions plus (beef, usually) stock. The description above is my past-years attempt at reducing the time I spend preparing F.O.S., and it stuck in my mind as a correct method.


Well, now I know why I complained about onion soup tasting with overwhelming onions. It's because I multiplied the quantity of onions in an attempt to avoid the caramelization step.

Why did my bagels flatten?,"This weekend, I made Peter Reinhart's water bagel recipe from *The Bread Baker's Apprentice*. The bagels taste yummy, but they're flat wrinkly discs! What can I do next time to get nice puffy bagels instead?


[![finished bagels](https://i.stack.imgur.com/muogr.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/muogr.jpg)


The recipe is basically:


* make a sponge and let it ferment for 2 hours
* add more yeast, salt, flour, and sweetener (I used Wheat Montana all-purpose flour, which yes is all-purpose but has a protein content closer to bread flour...so I was hoping it would behave more like bread flour)
* knead (I kneaded for about 20 minutes, until I got a nice smooth dough that passed the windowpane test)
* divide, form into rolls, rest for 20 minutes
* form bagels (after I was done forming them all I also went back and stretched out some of the first bagels I'd shaped a bit more)
* let rest for 20 minutes and then do the float test (mine passed the float test after the 20 minutes)


Here's what the bagels looked like at that point:
[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/G5EdL.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/G5EdL.jpg)


* put in refrigerator for up to 2 days (I had them in there for a little more than 24 hours)
* take out of the fridge and boil as soon as they pass the float test (mine did right away), 1 minute on each side. This is where things started going wrong. Mine puffed up nicely in the water, but then they started to deflate as soon as I took them out.
* bake. I saw my somewhat deflated boiled bagels and thought ""they'll spring up in the oven!"" but alas...basically no oven spring. You can see the result above.


The finished bagels are tasty and chewy, and the crumb is somewhat dense but not THAT bad:


[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UXuMw.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UXuMw.jpg)


But they're so flat!! The uncooked formed bagels almost look taller, like they spread out during/after boiling instead of poofing UP.


Here are my current hypotheses about what could have happened:


* I think I added the extra instant yeast and salt to the fermented sponge at the same time, so maybe the salt killed some of the yeast? But the bagels did poof up and pass the float test, so the yeast must have been active enough for that.
* I *was* using all-purpose flour instead of bread or high-gluten flour, and my understanding is that higher-gluten flour soaks up more water. So maybe the dough was too wet, using the same amount of water with all-purpose flour? I also didn't end up adding all of the flour the recipe called for - I was trying to pay attention to the dough foremost, so I stopped when it seemed to have a nice consistency with just a couple tablespoons of flour left to go. However, other bagel recipes (like this one <https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/81-how-to-make-bagels>) say you can use all purpose flour yet have an even higher hydration, and my dough did feel quite dry.
* Another potential downfall of that all-purpose flour: maybe there wasn't enough gluten development to hold up to the boiling. But I did knead it extensively, got the dough texture Reinhart describes, and have seen other bagel recipes that use all purpose flour without such flat results. Moreover, it seems like people recommend bread/high-gluten flour for ""extra chewy"" bagels, not poofier ones...and mine were chewy enough for my tastes.
* It seems like some other bagel recipes call for only 30 seconds of boiling on each side, so maybe my 1-minute on each side boil killed too much of the yeast to get a nice oven spring? But Reinhart's book says you can boil it for up to *two* minutes if you want extra chewy bagels.


What do you think? What should I try next time to get poofier happier bagels?


Update
======


Per Johanna's diagnosis of overproofing, I tried halving the yeast and then otherwise making the bagels as I did above (just with a bit of extra rise time for the sponge), and they turned out so much better!!


[![happy bagels](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2lSnP.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2lSnP.jpg)


I pulled out a couple after 4 hours in the fridge, and they puffed up well but were not particularly flavorful. The rest I took out and boiled after 24 hours, and those were great!

Where can I find strong sharp tasting olive oil in the US?,"I was hoping you could all educate me. I remember living in Turkey and travelling around the Mediterranean in general and a lot of the Olive Oil was sharper or you might call it bitter, and I know it was fresh. I loved the taste. In the US where I'm from, all the store bought olive oil that I've purchased is smooth and doesn't have any special kick to it. Why is that?


I assume it's for one of three reasons


1. I am not always the cheapest but I won't go all out and spend the most on something usually, and I wouldn't know what bottles to choose anyway.
2. The manufacturers know or think they know their market, and they think, probably correctly, that American's wouldn't go for that.
3. The process of storing and transporting it either reduces the sharpness or requires they refine it in a way that reduces it.


I'm interested in EVOO of course. I assume the stuff in the Mediterranean I ate was Extra Virgin but if it wasn't, that's fine too. I know it was fresh.


Am I correct with my reasons above, and more importantly where can I find sharp strong olive oil like I remember (including on Amazon)?

* I have seen **steam functions** in some brands (e.g., AEG), which I guess would come in handy (?).
* Are special **bread baking settings** (e.g., NEFF) useful?
* Is a **proofing function** useful, or is leaving on the light just as effective?
* Would a **food sensor**/**oven thermometer** be useful? Some ovens come with one that you can stick into meat (I guess probably also bread...), and it displays the temperature on the outside or stops when done. Good or bad for bread?
* People have recommended getting **telescopic rails** (e.g., Bosch and other brands). Are they still worth it if the oven is below the worktop?

Why is a pig-skin like substance floating on top of my vinegar?,"Apologies if this is off-topic.


Every year, I make about 25 litres of cider vinegar. I wash the apples in a bucket of tap water, press them, add a sachet of yeast and leave the fermenting vessel in the garage. The juice is very acidic so not very pleasant to drink. It does however make tasty vinegar.


I have several fermenting buckets in the garage each with a different vintage of vinegar. Floating in each is a jelly-like mother of vinegar. Today I discovered that the yeast in one of the vessels (18 month vintage) has gone a bit wonky. The mother is about an inch thick. It's mostly jelly-like but the very top has the texture of pig skin, is very tough, and smells like cheese. The vinegar has lost its acidic taste and also has a hint of cheese.

Could I use a blast chiller to make modern frozen meals at home?,"Over the last decade or so I have noticed that the quality of store-bought frozen meals has increased. And after heating, the quality of the frozen food is better than my own prepared meals that I freeze and reheat later. Vegetables, while usually not exactly crisp, are far less mushy than my leftovers even if they're vacuum-sealed. Pasta is pretty tender, sauces are pretty flavorful, and in pretty much every way my leftovers are outclassed after any length of time in the freezer.


As I understand, there is a fair bit involved in preparing those frozen meals at the factory but the most important element is rapid freezing in an extremely low-temperature freezer.


I recently saw a listing for a blast chiller small enough that it might reasonably fit in a residential kitchen, which led me to wonder: **could I prepare food, freeze it in the blast chiller, and then heat it later, essentially making my own frozen meals with quality comparable to the mass-produced frozen meals available today?**


For reference, here is [a link](https://www.bertolli.com/frozen-meals/skillet-meals/) to the type of frozen meal I'm describing (this is not intended to be an endorsement of or advertisement for this brand).

When can milk substitute for buttermilk in sourdough recipes?,"I want to prepare buttermilk sourdough pancakes:

* Two parts flour
* Two parts buttermilk
* Sugar to taste (about a quarter part, depending on mood)


The idea is to leave it overnight and let the sourdough [SCOBY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCOBY) incorporate the buttermilk culture. In the morning, the sponge can be used for pancakes, waffles, etc. At a chemical level, the yeast eat the flour and make sugars and carbon dioxide bubbles, the lactic acid bacteria eat lactose and other sugars and make lactic acid, the overall pH drops from a milky 8 to a sour 4, and the buttermilk effectively spoils but in a very controlled fashion.


I'm currently snowed in due to a blizzard. I don't have any buttermilk, but I do have some milk. From a chemist's perspective, surely the desired reaction will proceed eventually, and the only changes will be how long it takes for the culture to rise and sweeten, and the overall proportions of lactic acid bacteria. However, from a cooking perspective, those two things matter quite a bit. **What are the consequences of substituting milk for buttermilk in sourdough recipes?**

Cooking vs Soaking Lentils for Falafel,"So most traditional falafel recipes call for ""soaked chickpeas"", and particularly warn against using the canned version. I've been experimenting with making falafel out of lentils (mostly because they are more likely to be in my house), but have mostly struggled.


One key difference between the two is that many lentil-based falafel recipes say to cook the lentils first, but of course this makes them very soft (much softer then soaked chickpeas), and they tend to dissolve when fried (although they can be baked this way).


So, I'm really interested in the difference between soaking and cooking for chickpeas vs lentils. Are they totally equivalent? Is there any danger in soaking lentils (but not cooking them further) before turning them into falafel? Does frying uncooked (but soaked) chickpeas result in ""cooked"" chickpeas, or are you basically just eating raw chickpeas?

1. Open the lid and confirm you hear the popping sound (the seal breaking), and let it sit in the open for a few minutes, then put the lid back on and put it in the fridge
2. Wait a day, take it out and inspect
3. If there is any white foamy substance that sprung up overnight (strong indicator of botulism) or if there are strong off-putting odors, toss it
4. Otherwise have a bite and wait a day
5. If by the next day you haven't developed any upset stomach or other GI issues, it is very likely safe to consume the rest

Freezing sandwiches for toasting at work,"There's a sandwich press at my work and I'm trying to think of a way I can meal prep sandwiches for the whole week in one go. I'm thinking freezing them is the best bet, but I want them to be healthy as well and I'm not sure how vegetables will go in the freezer (probably badly).


Ideally I'll make all the sandwiches on Sunday, then put them in the freezer (wrapped in baking paper). Then, I'll take them to work in the morning (straight from the freezer), put them in the fridge when I get to work, and then put them straight in the sandwich press (inside the baking paper). That way I don't have to clean the press.

Why do I get a 'food burn' alert every time I use my pressure cooker?,"I have an Instant Pot that I love to use to prepare food, and for the first dozen meals it operated without issue. Lately, however, I get a 'food burn' alert every single time I use it. As expected, my food has stuck to the bottom of the detachable pot and needs to be scraped off. What is surprising me is that it isn't happening when I cook a specific meal, it's on every meal I prepare using the pressure cooker.


The same recipes that used to be prepared without issue now need to be scraped clean from the pot. I'm not altering the recipes, except to perhaps add more liquid to prevent food from sticking.

My oven seems to cook the outside faster than the inside,"I'm not in any way any kind of good cook, I just eat a lot of chicken breasts.


I used to have a bargain basement janky gas oven that I would run on full heat, and I would put a Costco precooked frozen chicken breast in (""cooking time 35-40 minutes fan oven 180 degrees"") and after 43 minutes it would come out absolutely perfect, with crispy skin and not too dry or tough.


I moved house and now have a more expensive oven, which is electric.


I have tried to cook my chicken breasts but the results are always disappointing. Generally, the skin seems to cook then burn. The instructions say 180C so I have used a laser temperature probe pointed at the chicken and adjusted the dial so that this value is 180C.


I find that after 33 mins the skin starts to burn. So I often cook it for around 30 minutes but it's a little bit tough and doesn't taste as great as my old oven.


I can't really tell what I should change to improve it. I feel like I need to cook the inside longer without burning the outside, but I am not certain.


The variables I can think of are to increase/decrease the temperature and increase/decrease the cooking time.


Is there a general rule of thumb about temperature vs time based on what aspect of your food is cooking incorrectly?

Why do apples bleed after soaking in boiling water for 10 seconds and what substance is it?,"I was trying to remove the wax. I don't really know what kind of wax is used.

What could cause ice pops (popsicles) to go soft in the freezer?,"I’m having a strange issue with the storage of ice pops (popsicles/ice lollies) in the freezer. I recently bought a new freezer and still have the exact same issue which we can’t figure out.


Whenever we buy ice pops in our house, we put them straight into the freezer. We sometimes leave them in the box but usually remove them, which doesn’t seem to make a difference to their texture. However, even if they’re rock hard going in, they keep coming out soft, sometimes even melted. Every single time.


Here’s the weird part: everything else in the freezer is rock solid frozen! No other foods go soft regardless of how long they’ve been in there.


Also, as I mentioned, it happened in our old freezer and now our new one (which is 4\* freezing). How much or how little we have in the freezer seems to make no difference. This only happens with ice pops (and ice cream cones) but no other food.


This might sound silly, but the only change in my freezer storage habits since we first noticed this problem is that we bought silicone ice trays with lids a few months ago; two of them which we stack on top of each other in the very edge. Part of me wonders if there’s some kind of chemical (since they’re cheap trays that are no longer sold by the seller they’re purchased from online) that could be affecting the ice pops, since they’re usually the only food near the ice trays. Though I do switch foods around to check freezing is consistent in all parts of the freezer, which it is. But the tray idea sounds like superstitious logic even to me.


Am I missing some kind of storage wisdom in regards to frozen sweet treats?

Vegetable stock, on the other hand, is broadly similar to the mirepoix that's used as the basis for a huge number of savoury dishes: onion, carrot and celery.

So why not do the same for a stock? I'm specifically thinking of ways to try and add flavour to the broth of vegan noodle dishes, and I'm struggling to see a reason why I wouldn't just grate the onion, carrot and celery and leave it in the stock for texture and better nutritional value.

* taste each jar after 1 week
* if too salty, mix in another daikon to ""thin out"" and distribute the salt over more material.

* use a fresh fork to taste each jar

How to heat up a pan on an induction burner?,"When it comes to a cast-iron skillet, the benefit of using traditional methods is that if you want a super hot pan, you heat it for a long period of time before adding fat to the pan. The instructions say never place an empty pan on an induction burner. So for me adding oil at the beginning was non-sensical, Within a very short period of time the oil was smoking but the pan itself was cold except for the bottom. So how do you get a screaming hot cast iron pan before adding any fat?

Undoing the flavor effects of baking soda in cooking,"I recently learned that if you put a bit of sodium bicarbonate on onion when frying it, the onion will literally melt away. This is absolutely amazing, and I love that trick.


But I tried it now when I was cooking some tomato sauce, and while the mouthfeel was incredibly creaming (as opposed to a bit chewy when I do without), there was a clear and ever present sensation of the baking soda at the back of my throat.


Is it just because I've put too much baking soda (about half a teaspoon for one small-medium onion, and also two and a half plum tomatoes that came in shortly thereafter), or is there something else to do to resolve this without changing the intended flavor profile too much? (I don't want to add vinegar, for example, if that causes the sauce to taste like vinegar)

Is there a way to make a generic cheese sauce?,"***Scenario***: I have some nuggets, and thought it would be nice to dip them in some cheese sauce. I do not have that, but I thought I could make one with the ingredients I have. But I am not sure if there is a way to make a ***MORE OR LESS*** **generic** cheese sauce.


This is the cheese I have:

Ingredients in dutch: **melk**\* (milk), zout (salt), zuursel (starter culture) and stremsel (which is Rennet, I am not sure what kind of cheese that is).
**My main idea was melting the cheese with an amount of butter, salt, and maybe some milk or cooking cream.** (No need of quantities right now but more of the process to follow).


I think that adding flour would be like making a cheesy bechamel, and I don't know if that is good to dip (or put on top of nachos, whatever is fine, as a cheese sauce, it's nice anywhere). But maybe flour is necessary for this process (specially if the cheese may be quite generic as well).

Substitute clarified butter with sunflower spread,"### Background


I am making a sweet recipe of Baklava, which calls on ghee or clarified butter.
So the butter substitute would be used to paint on the layers of filo pastry before baking.


### My problem


When reading the ingredients list I instinctively substituted butter for sunflower spread as an acceptable dairy free alternative, not realising the process I would have to expose it to.


### Question


Now given what is the desired outcome of clarified butter, I’m assuming this wouldn’t work by using sunflower spread? .. Or would it?


If not, any suggestions to how I can get around this mess without butter?


### The instructions I have for making clarified butter


Melt the 1 1/2 cups (340g/ 12oz) butter slowly over medium low heat until the milk solids have separated from the butterfat. and collected on the bottom of the saucepan. Remove the pan from heat, let the butter settle for 10 minutes, then carefully skim the foam from the surface with a spoon. Slowly pour the clear butterfat into a bowl, leaving all the milk solids behind in the saucepan. You should end up with about 1 1/8 cup (255g/ 9oz) clarified butter.


Any thoughts, suggestions or workarounds much appreciated!

Pudding vs. laundry starch - Add water gradually or all at once?,"I recently watched a YouTube video ""[How to use old fashioned starch](https://youtu.be/fkbRmymbeO4)"" by Constance MacKenzie about how laundry was starched in ye olde time. The only relevant information for my question is that you can use potato, wheat or rice starch and that it must be made into a paste with water and boiled, very similar to a pudding / blancmange / custard. Laundry starch has only those 2 ingredients: starch and water.


The process in the video started by mixing the starch into a little amount of cold water. This was then put on the stove at medium heat and roughly ""a kettle full"" of hot (but not boiling) water was added in very small increments under constant stirring. The mixture only started boiling after all of the water was added.


This process reminded me of making a roux sauce. You start with melted butter and flour and have to add the liquid in small increments to avoid lumps. It makes sense to first evenly mix butter and flour because the butter would probably stay seperated otherwise. But laundry starch doesn't contain any butter or fat.


If you added some flavors to the laundry starch you would end up with an edible pudding / blancmange / custard. Those are usually made by mixing all the ingredients and then heating them up with all the liquid already incorporated. This has the benefit or avoiding lumps. So I see no reason why the laundry starch needs to start with such a small amount of water that needs to be tediously increased in increments.


On the other hand, I learned that our ancestors weren't half as stupid as we make them seem and probably had reasons for starting with less water. They may not have understood the chemistry and physics behind the process, but they had much more practical experience.


My question is:


Is there a difference in the physical or chemical properties of starch if you:


* start with a small amount of water and gradually add more **while** heating the mixture, or
* add all the water **before** heating the mixture


assuming you never stop stirring during the process and you let the mixture boil until it looks translucent? It may be important to keep in mind that the quality of the end result (starched laundry) depends on the properties of the **dehydrated, coocked starch**.

Add sugar to Taco Seasoning?,"Do I add sugar? So many people have told me they put sugar in their seasoning and I don't understand why. What does sugar provide to this recipe and how much should I experiment with?


This is the recipe in progress.


* 4 Tbsp smoked paprika
* 4 Tbsp sweet paprika
* 2 Tbsp dried oregano
* 1 Tbsp cornstarch
* 1 Tbsp **finely** ground kosher salt
* 1 Tbsp **freshly** ground cumin seed
* 1 Tsp **freshly** ground coriander seed
* 1 Tsp **freshly** ground pepper
* 1 Bulb garlic
* 1 Red onion
* 1/4 lb cayenne peppers


Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, and Cayenne Powder


Prepare Garlic


1. Break apart garlic bulb into cloves
2. Remove all Garlic sheaths from cloves
3. Finely slice all garlic cloves
4. Lay sliced garlic cloves in a single layer on a baking sheet


Prepare Onion


1. Remove the outer skin of the onion until you have a nice looking skin all the way around
2. Remove the top 1/4"" and bottom 1/4"" of onion
3. Slice the entire onion very thin
4. Place the onion in a single layer across a baking sheet.


Prepare Cayenne Peppers


1. Cut the ends off the peppers
2. Dice them finely
3. Arrange the diced cayenne peppers in a single layer on a baking sheet


Dehydrator


1. If you have a dehydrator, that's much quicker and faster.
2. 140° F for about 5 hours should do it all


Oven Dehydration


1. Place baking sheets into the oven and turn to 150° F
2. Release vapor every 1/2 hour by opening the oven for 1 minute
3. Process should take about 6 hours


When the dehydration process is complete, then grind each of the spices into their own bowls and measure out 1 Tbsp of each.


Place all ingredients together in a medium bowl and then seal in an air-tight container.


I use 3 Tbsp of the mix per lb of anything I want to mix it in with.

I mean sure -- these are good pointers on how to get from point A (""I have raw milk"") to point B (""I have sour cream""), but very little actual information on the underlying workings (what happens if I leave it out for 3 or 4 days? After I gather the cream, what is the remaining transparent liquid in the jar and what can I do with it? etc).


**Basically, I'm not looking for specifics on how to get from a point A to a point B, but rather -- if I'm at point A, what points can I get to from there, and where can I get to afterwards?**

Could I use a sous vide rack for cooking lasagna in boiling water?,"I enjoy cooking my lasagnas in boiling water before using them in the pan.

* the noodles will still stick together;
* the noodles fall on the bottom of the pot making the water suddenly boil with unexpected bigger bubbles;

Is there such a thing as a dish being bland from too many flavors?,"My girlfriend has asked for my opinion on a few dishes that she has been experimenting with, and not being particularly well-versed in the language used to discuss food, I have been having trouble expressing my opinion on two specific dishes (namely, a stew using ground beef and a Thai curry with chicken).


I have eaten several different versions of both dishes over several months, so I have developed a pretty good sense of which versions of them I like the best. We have also tried similar dishes from local restaurants in order to have a common reference point. Generally, I think that the dishes taste fine, but sometimes I feel that they become ""bland"" (for lack of a better word) from too many spices.


What I mean is that sometimes when she prepares them she will use only a few specific spices or none at all and more fresh ingredients. To me, these versions taste the best. They have strong, distinct flavors, and I think that they taste more like the restaurant dishes that we've compared them to. However, she usually finds these versions under-seasoned, so she also experiments with adding lots of different spices. When she does this, she still isn't happy with the result but she says that the dishes taste more ""complete"" or more ""harmonious"" or just generally better. On the other hand, I think that these versions taste same-y or bland, which she doesn't understand since there are objectively more flavors in the dish. I have tried to describe it like the flavor equivalent of that color of brown you get when you mix all the paints together or if an orchestra just played all the instruments at once without regard to the timing.


To me, these versions sort of feel like filling in all the nooks and crannies of the flavor landscape to make the experience boring and flat. She says that I just don't understand flavor and that that's not a thing that happens. She says that adding more flavors complement and round-out the taste.


I am nowhere near as knowledgeable about food words as my girlfriend, and she also has a much more sensitive and discerning palate than I do. So it may be possible that I am just a bad food critic, but I would really like to understand my experience better and hopefully communicate it better to my girlfriend. My question is this: **Is there such a thing as ""the flavor equivalent of the color brown"" in the sense that too many different flavors can make food sort of taste bland?

What is a refrigerator tray in older recipes?,"Many older cookbooks call for filling a “refrigerator tray”. For example, in the 1960 *Better Homes and Gardens Dessert Cook Book* the recipe for “Banana Ice Cream” says to “Pour into refrigerator trays. Freeze till firm.” and in Anne London’s 1972 *American-International Encyclopedic Cookbook*, the recipe for “Refrigerator Tray Pie” says to “Pack half the crumb mixture into a refrigerator tray. Chill… Return to refrigerator to freeze.”


Doing a search for “refrigerator tray” on archive.org, I found the pamphlet for [Use and Care of Your New Norge Refrigerator](https://archive.org/details/norgerefrigerator/page/n9/mode/2up) which mentions many uses for refrigerator trays, all involving freezing in some way. From the various recipes for ice cream and other frozen desserts on pages 31-32,



> 
> Pour into refrigerator trays and freeze.
> 
> 
> 



> 
> Freeze in refrigerator tray.
> 
> 
> 



> 
> …freeze in refrigerator tray until firm.
> 
> 
> 


From this, I can deduce that a refrigerator tray is something that you can pour liquids into and then put into the freezer, but that’s about it.


Those pages also mention trays without the qualifier “refrigerator”:



> 
> Pour into tray of chilling unit and freeze to mush.
> 
>

> 
> Pour into tray and chill to soft jelly… Return to tray and freeze to desired firmness.

I would guess that the ice trays mentioned are the metal trays for making ice cubes, which used to come with a removable (always metal, in my limited experience) divider that doubled as a loosening device for the ice cubes. They seem awfully small for use as a dessert pan, but then the Better Homes and Garden recipe did use the plural for its mention of refrigerator trays.

Microwave Oven Operating Frequencies,"I have read that industrial microwave ovens operate at 900 MHz rather than the more common 2.4 GHz ovens found in most homes.


Why is this?


Some examples of this claim:

[Comparing Microwave to Conventional Heating & Drying](https://www.manufacturing.net/home/article/13149658/comparing-microwave-to-conventional-heating-drying)

What is this cast iron skillet with diagonal ribs intended for?,"I'm not actually sure if ""skillet"" is the right word for this, but it seems close. We got this second hand, so not sure of its origin.


The particular feature that I'm not sure of is the set of diagonal raised 'ribs'. Seems like they would keep the food items from the bottom surface. Is this something like what you would use a wire rack for when baking?


It is 10 x 10 in. (25 x 25 cm) and 1 1/2"" deep.


Is this skillet intended for something specific? We're located in the USA if that makes any difference.

Why are most circular pizza peels designed with holes in metal,"I am looking to buy a pizza peel. In the UK, I'm noticing a difference in styles, and was curious if there was a reason more than design


There is the ""paddle"" design, which is more rectangular and a solid piece of metal


[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ryH5A.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ryH5A.png)


Almost all of the longer handled circular (rounded) peels seem to have holes in the metal as per below.


[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/h5rec.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/h5rec.png)


This design seems counter intuitive to me - the dough could easily sink into the hole making it more difficult to slide the pizza off. Not only that, but by having holes, there is less area to be floured before putting the pizza on top of the peel


Given both of the designs are (as far as I know) designed for the same purpose (to transfer the pizza), is there a reason why circular peels with longer handles seem to all have cut outs like the picture above? If any one has used them, does it hinder transfer (or at least, sliding the pizza off)

Are these both ways okay to lower the flame in these types of gas stoves?,"Before asking this question, I really tried to find an answer online, but I failed. Basically, we mostly have manual igniting gas stoves. If you press and turn the button on left (90 degree) and use a lighter/matchbox, it gets turned on. To lower the flame, you just turn it further a bit on **left**.


But my mom has always warned me to not to turn it so left that it becomes 180 degrees. **I wonder what happens after that**. Further, my mon never told me what happens when you keep the button between 0 degree and 90 degrees. I feel it should also lower the flame just like when the button is between 90 degree and 180 degree (i.e., turned to very left). **Because I don't see any point in the design of a button that goes from 0 degree to straight 90 degree and between them you are not supposed to get anything. And you're not supposed to do this to lower the flame**. I feel there can be a reason for it but I don't know if that's right or wrong.


I'm not sure of any these things and I can't even experiment as it's dangerous stuff.


I really felt frustrated when I googled this and I saw results like:


1. Fix your low/high frame
2. Your burners are malfunctioning. How to fix at home
3. Your gas stove buttons fix\*


But I don't have any problem with my gas stove. I got really *tired* of all these. Neither I could find a video on YouTube.


I *can't* show you exact model of my gas stove as it is made by some not so known brands, but looks like most gas stoves in my neighborhood are like these. Otherwise my neighborhood people *won't* be able to know how to use our gas stoves (unless you know how to operate multiple types of stoves). Similarly, my mon also knows how to operate theirs. All are same and manual.


Even when I visited New Delhi, which is a big city than my hometown, I found same settings, but I didn't ask them how to operate, because everyone knew same things which I knew. **So I felt they will also don't know what happens between the 0 degree and 90 degree.**

*(a) When button is between 0° and 90°*

**If yes**, is it safe to keep the button between 0 degree and 90 degree *(just the way you use to lower the flame by keeping the button between 90 degree and 180 degree)*?


**If no**, what would be the reason for it? *(Asking this because I really can't believe this fact. I feel it would be a bad design. A new user is very likely to keep the button between 0 degree and 90 degree because there's generally no warning/alarm for it unless someone tells you not to do it)*

Electric cooktop for sous vide-level precision?,"Yes, I know, but bear with me here.


I've been thinking about getting an electric cooktop, and reading about them online a lot of people seem to mention that on some of the low settings, their cooktop will keep water at a constant boiling/simmering temperatures, like, say, 90 C (194 F)


In order for that to happen, it must mean that the heating element itself is only heating up to that temperature, high? And thus of course the temperature cannot get higher than the hot plate itself.


By that logic, if an electric cooktop happened to have a setting that would leave it at around 74 C (165 F), does that mean I could use it to cook some chicken breast precisely to its safe internal temperature?


Would be like a sous vide - no risk of over- or undercooking it! Right? Or am I missing something?


EDIT: For further clarification, when I say electric, I mean traditional ones with a solid plate burner. Sorry!




---


EDIT 2: Okay, so not sous vide-level precision. I've learned a lot from your wonderful answers, and my new plan is to lower my standards and attempt the following:


1. Putting a pot of water with a lid on the electric coil cooker (so it's an enclosed space filled with a great thermal conductor)
2. Cycle the device on and off figure out a rate for, erhm... manual time modulation that would keep the coil at X+Y Celsius (where X is the temp I want and Y is however many more degrees it needs to be to compensate for heat loss, which I would need to figure out for that setup as well)
3. Turn it on and off again at regular intervals according to the rate I found (yeah impractical but I could get a smart outlet to do it for me if it works!)


Maybe I could get a large pot (more thermal mass, less temp variation) and exclusively use it for this (more consistent setup, less temp variation), and figure out a reliable duty cycle that keeps it at a given temperature for three different quantities of water (such as a third, two thirds, and nearly full capacity).


Hopefully I can end up with water consistently at maybe +-4 C of a target temperature, and finally achieve hands-off, dummy-proof cooking! (useful since I can be a bit of a dummy sometimes). If you're wondering why I don't get a circulator, I've made a comment down below to clarify.

Is it safe to only rinse visible residue from container if I then refrigerate the container?,"I like to eat off silicone containers. I've noticed that if I rinse them right away after eating, there will be basically no visible residue left on the surface.


Now let's say that, err, I had a friend who is lazy and gross and was considering rinsing a container that way and placing it in the fridge in between meals, eating in that same container throughout the day and only washing it properly after dinner.


That would be yucky, yes, but not dangerous, right? Since the fridge can keep a whole container of food safe for a few days, surely it can keep some microscopic food residue safe from morning until night? The food would only stay briefly in the temperature danger zone (4-60 C or 40-140 F) when eating, so it wouldn't add up to two hours of non-safe temp throughout the day.


I coul-I mean, my friend could even rinse with hot water, or place it in the freezer instead to make extra sure. Or you know, actually wash it for real, but it's a really lazy person I'm talking about here.


EDIT - To summarize: I want to know whether it is dangerous to not fully clean the container in between meals throughout a day (like three or four times). I would only give it a quick rinse to remove visible residue, and then keep it under 4 C / 40 F, where bacteria won't grow too quickly (and then clean it properly afterward for the next day).

Cheese soufflé with bread cubes instead of egg whites,"In this video: [Cheese Soufflé that NEVER Falls! - Chef Jean-Pierre](https://youtu.be/yOtyDzUS7ko), Chef Jean Pierre proposes an interesting method for making cheese soufflé; instead of folding in beaten egg whites to his custard, he uses diced bread cubes (with crust removed) to provide the air that will make the soufflé rise.


His reasoning for using bread is that the soufflé will not fall (only slightly) and could thus be fully cooked in advance (hence making a foolproof recipe for beginner cooks).


This method relies on 2 key aspects:


1. The bread is broken down in the heated custard environment and
2. The soufflé will not fall because of the bread


Could someone explain from a chemistry perspective why 1) and 2) occur?


For 2), my guess is the broken down bread provides better structural integrity than egg whites, though I am not sure why.

"From a food safety perspective, what's the difference between a dish I ate in and rinsed off afterward vs. a dish with food that I didn't eat in?","I have asked the following question before: [Is it safe to only rinse visible residue from container if I then refrigerate the container?](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/115130/is-it-safe-to-only-rinse-visible-residue-from-container-if-i-then-refrigerate-th)


I've gotten some great answers to it which help me further understand the variables at play here, but I stubbornly suspect a large part of their final conclusions was influenced by gut instinct, rather than genuine consideration of the scenario vs. other more traditional practices that are considered food safe.


(EDIT: I was wrong! It appears the defining factor here is the bacteria that would be introduced by eating - specifically the stuff in the saliva that would be transferred into the container via cutlery.)


I've then decided to ask a more specific, more rigorous question, which would hopefully help me decide whether I am wrong in this analysis, and if so, why. **I propose two scenarios:**


Scenario 1
----------


Say I came up with a hypothetical monster recipe that included some scrambled eggs, pot roast, broccoli with cheese, steak, and black bean chilli. Then I took half of it, had a horrible time eating it, and left the rest in the fridge until the end of the night, when I reluctantly ate the rest.


(*Wow, that wouldn't be a very good recipe!* Yes, I agree.)


Scenario 2
----------


Say the next day I decided that all that stuff would taste better separately, and prepared each meal individually throughout the day. I then ate each meal off the same dish, rinsing it afterward in a manner that would remove all visible residue from the dish.


For the purpose of the question, assume I rigorously measured the total sum (food+container) of time spent in the temperature danger zone, including transportation, preparation and storage, and taking into account time to cool down in the fridge etc, and it added up to exactly an hour and thirty minutes in both scenarios. I am aware it would be more difficult to perform such a calculation in Scenario 2.


I know Scenario 2 sounds more gross, but are there factors that make it worse from a food-safety perspective than Scenario 1? Would Scenario 1 be considered not food safe by government standards (due to cross contamination and mixing a lot of foods)? If not, why would Scenario 2 be any less safe? One could argue it would be even *more* safe, given that there is way less food in the container most of the time (a microscopic amount).


The only thing I can think of that would make it worse is the potential presence of saliva in a dish I've eaten in vs one I haven't, which would interact with the microscopic residue left on the dish - but I imagine the water would readily rinse away the spit.

How can a tandoor oven cook skewered meat evenly,"I am going to build or buy a tandoor. Before I invest, I have done some research into how to cook in one.

Sous vide topside beef- what went wrong?,"So, I’ve had many sous vide successes over the years but yesterday suffered what feels like a big failure and I’ve no idea why.


Long story short, I had a 2kg beef topside joint which I seasoned with plenty of salt and pepper then cooked for four hours at 56C. When I took it out of the water it felt deliciously soft- even delicate. I cooled it immediately in a cold water bath and then left it in the fridge overnight.


The next day I blasted it in the air fryer on as hot as it gets until the fat left on it browned and caramelised. At this point it looked and smelled fantastic.


The problem is that when sliced and served the meat is **extremely** chewy and not nice at all to eat. Parts of it that were not chewy were absolutely delightful and tasted great but so far the majority of it has needed prolonged chewing then spit out what’s left of that mouthful. It breaks my heart to see a mountain of chewed meat left on a plate!


So I’m wondering what I did wrong? Most recipes online suggested 56C and 4hrs were the correct choices. At this point I’m stumped. Could it just be as simple as a tough piece of meat? What can I do to save it, since I’m not really looking forward to eating any more of it right now?

I used that pan JUST on Electric Cook Top in my house. I never knew overheating can damage non-stick surface! Someone asked how do I heat it? I usually oil the surface with Sunflower or Safflower Oil — because they have high smoke points! I usually just use medium or medium high heat. SOMETIMES I crank up the cooktop to max heat — if the pan holds many ingredients and the food is cooking too slowly — or if I want to stir fry rice, noodles, vegetables, seafood like Asians.


At max or high heat, I NEVER leave the pan empty or dry on high heat!!! On low to medium heat, the pan can be empty or dry when I am offloading ingredients and onloading new ingredients. Like if I finish stir frying ginger and rice at high heat, I turn down cooktop to low heat. Then I pour out vegetables. Now pan is empty. Then I pour in my raw vegetables and crank back up to high heat.


Now I have a question. I paid $129.99 + 13% tax in Ontario Canada = $147 for this pan. Can someone fix this damage? Is it economical to fix? Or smarter to buy a new pan? I contacted Zwilling about a replacement.

Can any liquid food be beaten into a mousse?,"[Hervé This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herv%C3%A9_This) discovered that one can make chocolate mousse with chocolate and water only.


This recipe is shown in [this MasterChef video](https://youtu.be/F6oMIo3GTQ8), and also detailed [here](https://food52.com/recipes/16044-herve-this-chocolate-mousse).


Essentially, one melts chocolate with water, then whisks it over an ice bath to incorporate air bubbles, and after a while the mousse is formed.

How to remove every insect from romaine lettuce?,"How do I get rid of tiny insects on my lettuce, I know that there will always be insects on it but I'm so paranoid about it. I have a huge fear and I love lettuce so much. I get rid of most insects by first removing each leaf, soaking the lettuce in a vinegar water mix for 10 minutes or so, and running each individual lettuce leaf through water.


Usually this works, but I always get these little insects that don't seem to get off, I literally see them holding on to dear life when I run water through them.

How to properly clean raw chicken cut in pieces?,"In the country where I live, whole chicken is the cheapest protein you can buy and I cook it every week at home. I always ask the butcher to cut it into pieces for me and I use it for stews, grilled, fried, cooked in the oven, anyway you can imagine. It is cheap and incredibly versatile, selling for around 1,6€/kg. The closest meat product would be pork chops selling for around 3,5€/kg.


Because the chicken is cut in pieces it comes with small bits of fat and chicken insides that don't taste or look good in my dishes. I remove these with a knife and then wash chicken under running water to remove the smaller bits. If I don't wash the chicken I get smaller bits of fat and blood vessels in my food. But I was horrified to stumble into articles that say washing raw chicken isn't safe. It spreads bacteria into the countertops and the sink and there's evidence that the bacteria can remain after the kitchen is washed. Everyone agrees washing raw chicken isn't safe. The alternative is patting the chicken with kitchen paper, but this will make it hard to remove the small bits of blood and whatnot that are holding on to the chicken. What can I do to safely clean my chicken?

Meat loses weight after some time,"Context
=======


My physic teacher told a story where he bought some beef, put them into
a vacuum (separated), measured their weight and put them into the freezer. Some days later he wanted to cook one of them but he couldn't see a difference between the beefs and his other meats. So he decided to weight them since he wrote their weight down before. Surprisingly none of them had one of the noted weights, he told that they were completely different. His biggest beef weighed about 1.300g but now it weigh less (I can't remember the number anymore).


What's your question?
=====================


What could be the reasons that the beefs lost their weights, although they were packed in a vacuum and put into a freezer?

Is it ok to eat kimchi that is causing its package to expand?,"For non-fermented foods, I feel like it's obvious that they shouldn't be consumed if they're causing the package they're stored in to expand, even if they're still within the ""best by"" date. Does this apply to fermented foods like kimchi?


I had some yesterday and, while it's still in date (just), the sealed package was notably ""inflated"". It popped when opening and the kimchi made a ""fizzing"" sound for a little while. It didn't smell off and it tasted OK, albeit a little more acidic than usual. So far I haven't suffered any adverse effects.

How does the flavour from aromatics actually get into food?,"I've always wondered what the exact mechanism is which allows flavours from aromatics to permeate food. For instance, I bake chicken with sliced lemon, sliced garlic, and parsley (each in hefty amounts), and it doesn't really seem to matter where the aromatics are in the pan when I put it in the oven, as the chicken still comes out with some of the flavour.


I haven't been able to find an answer online, perhaps because it's simpler than I'm imagining. Is the chicken basting in a liquid flavoured with the aromatics? Are the flavours of the aromatics carried in evaporating water molecules through the air?


Also, what are the implications of this mechanism of flavour transfer? For instance, where should my aromatics be placed relative to my food in order to maximize flavour transfer, and what ingredients work best as aromatics?


If flavours are aerosolized and transfer to the food that way, is it a good idea to loosely cover the food with aluminum foil before putting it in the oven to ""trap"" the flavour particles?

Is MSG able to penetrate meat like chicken breast and steak when dissolved in a brine?,"I am trying to figure out whether adding MSG to a water based brine will allow the MSG to 'penetrate' the meat. I know it is soluble, but I'm not sure whether this means it will be able to diffuse into the meat in the same way regular salt does.

Can you season over some thin flash rust and get a usable pan as a result? What are the downsides of doing so?,"I've had a carbon steel pan with some thin flash rust spots. I've tried to remove them by scrubbing, but after applying a new layer of seasoning it turned out I hadn't removed all of it.


While I find a lot of posts online about how to remove rust from pans and how to prevent rust in pans, I can't find a clear answer to the question whether a thin layer of rust under layers of seasoning is actually harmful. The way I see it, once there's enough seasoning on top of the rust there won't be any oxygen for the rust to expand and the surface that touches your food is free of rust.


What are the downsides when you have some flash rust in a carbon steel pan and continue seasoning over it until the pan stops giving off rust when rubbed with an oily paper towel?


Some of the problems I can imagine happening (but I'm not sure if they will happen):


* The seasoning won't hold onto the pan as well as it would without the flash rust.
* The new layers of seasoning won't 'grab onto' the rusty parts meaning that you will never arrive at a point where the existing rust is trapped inside layers of seasoning. In other words, when rubbing it with an oily paper towel the pan will always continue giving off some rust.

Can I refrigerate lower hydration dough for storage like I would no-knead dough?,"I've been baking with the Artisan Bread in 5 minutes a day recipe for nearly a decade, off an on, and like a lot of people I decided to try to step up my game over the last year. I feel like I've reached the point where I have a good mastery of techniques with that recipe, and wanted to try out a more ""standard"", knead-needing, lower hydration recipe.


So I whipped up a batch of the basic dough in the river cottage bread handbook (60% hydration, all bread flour), and *damn son*. Compared to what I was getting with my no knead dough, *that crust*.


So now I want to figure out how to combine the best aspects of these recipes, which to me would mean be able to make larger batches at a time and refrigerate to use over a few days. I don't mind kneading at all, and taking the time to punch down etc.


I'm not sure what makes the no knead recipe work well with the fridge. My *guess* is that, since I'm not building up and long gluten chains by hand, I don't have to worry about it over fermenting and breaking down the gluten structure after several days of fridge time, maybe?


So how would I apply this to a more ""normal"", kneaded dough? Maybe just toss it in before final proof but it's only good for 2-3 days? Maybe do one less punch down and rise before putting it in? Maybe dont bulk ferment at room temp at all, just knead and straight into the fridge? And in that last case, maybe give it time for an extra rise at room temp before the final proof if I take it out on the first day or two?


I know I should probably just try to figure this out in my own but that would take a lot of flour =)

"Is ""mintiness"" a well-defined thing?","I perceive a similarity in taste and odour between spearmint and peppermint, and I describe both as minty. The smell, taste and cooling sensation of peppermint are reproduced almost perfectly by pure menthol. But spearmint, despite being very closely related to peppermint, contains very little menthol, and it apparently gets its character from R-carvone, which is also found in caraway, which exhibits a vaguely minty aroma.


To me, lemon balm smells primarily like lemon, and not at all minty. Wild watermint (from which peppermint is obtained by hybridisation with spearmint) smells, to me, vaguely minty but also disagreeably vegetal, like lots of inedible greens do. Likewise catnip. And most other mint varieties sold in garden centres for culinary purposes (pineapple mint etc) smell, to me, similarly like weak mint with unpleasant off-notes.


On the other hand, pennyroyal and hyssop both smell unmistakably minty and pleasant to me.


What, then, do the two best-known mints have in common that makes them identifiably minty? Is it anything inherent to their makeup, or is it just mental association?


I've seen some Americans describe wintergreen as a type of mint. Botanically that's not true at all, and wintergreen oil's chemical composition is very different from the mints. I'm from the UK, where wintergreen is very rare as a food flavouring, and its smell is primarily associated with medicines and liniments. I don't perceive it as having a minty quality at all. I can recognise that it's pungent and herbal, so it has similarities to (for instance) eucalyptus, camphor, pine, rosemary, juniper etc, and in that sense, it's vaguely like the mints, but no more so than any of those other plants listed.


So I believe that when an American describes wintergreen as minty, it's because a) for them, the flavour is associated with the herbal candies referred to as ""mints"", and b) in broad terms, it's in the same sort of category. Is it the case that I similarly consider spearmint and peppermint both to be ""minty"", just because I'm used to using the word mint for both of them, even though they're very different chemically?


Addendum: here to illustrate the chemical differences are gas chromatography analyses.


[Peppermint oil is primarily eucalyptol, menthol, menthone, menthofuran, menthyl acetate and iso-menthone](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/analytical-applications/gc/gc-analysis-of-peppermint-essential-oil-g005835.html)

However, I have never seen it recommended as a way to add ""body"" and texture to a vegan stock, as a replacement for the collagen in meat stocks. Particularly, I'd like to experiment with it for vegetable stocks intended to be thickened into a sauce.


Is this because it works poorly for that purpose, or just because few cooks have tried it? Or some other reason?

Storing Self-Made Cookies/Brittles/etc longer: ingredients and techniques,"I like to make a large amount of pan sheet cookies or brownie brittles as something to crumble over my breakfast yogurt.

I let the brittle bake for fairly long, and let it cool and harden over the entire day so that it has no moisture left. Then I store it in a closed glass container in a shelf at room temperature.


They keep fairly well but after 2-3 weeks, a tiny bit of mold starts to form, faster than I can eat them.
Any ideas on how I could keep it longer? Ideally, they would store for up to 4 weeks.

What are the reasons for using an egg whisk to cook scrambled eggs?,"When cooking scrambled eggs in the frypan I use a spatula to gather the egg together. To me this doesn't damage the pan, and avoids the egg forming 'nodules'. It also saves the time-consuming hassle of cleaning cooked egg off the egg whisk, and possibly saves the hygiene risk of not properly cleaning all of the egg off the egg whisk.


Now I could be completely wrong or have missed something. I know of people who are strongly in favour of using an egg whisk to cook scrambled eggs.

Does starch thickened custard get thinner after a few days?,"A few days ago, I did a crème pâtissière (thick vanilla custard), using


* milk (300ml/1.25 cup)
* egg yolks (2)
* sugar (15g/1tbsp)
* potato starch (10g/1tbsp).


The end result had a relatively thick consistency, fit for my purpose. I had a bit left over, so I put it in the fridge after it cooled down. After a few days in the fridge, the custard got thinner, like a crème anglaise (thin vanilla custard, picture an eggnog-like consistency).

"Aside from saving gas or electricity, why cover the pot?","There are some recipes that insist that you have to cover the pot when cooking. For example, in [this video recipe for Bolognese sauce](https://youtu.be/9b3SMmilycw?t=456) (at 7:36).


I understand that this might save gas or electricity by reducing heat loss. But does it serve any other purpose?


I do not consider it to be essential for the food not drying up, since you can leave the pot uncovered and just add a bit more water at the beginning, or add water at the end if you notice that too much has evaporated.


The only thing I can think about is that this might increase the humidity inside the pot, and perhaps the steam will help cook the food or change the flavor somehow. If this is true, what types of food would benefit from cooking with the lid on in terms of flavor?

How do I peel prosciutto from wax paper without it coming off in strips?,"Anytime I've purchased prosciutto from a store it's sold in slices separated by pieces of wax paper, but when I try and peel it off it doesn't peel evenly. The lines of fat in the ham offers less strength when peeling, and the prosciutto often tears along these lines.


When trying to make sandwiches it isn't too much of an aesthetic issue, but if I'm trying to make a charcuterie board having thin strips isn't as appealing. Is there some best way to scrape the meat from the wax paper, peel from both ends simultaneously? Or is this an inconvenience I'll just have to deal with?

Why not incorporate eggs at the last moment when making crepes?,"My question is about the sequence/timing of adding the ingredients.


In all crepes recipes I have seen, eggs are added before the batter is mixed. I wonder if it would make sense to add them after.


Two possible advantages:


1. I believe if eggs are mixed too much, whites can get a rubber-like texture. This is especially true when an electric mixer is used. Is this correct? Incorporating eggs at the last moment will allow using electric mixer (on milk and flour) without compromising the texture.
2. Eggs are fresher when they are in their shell. I guess if the batter is left for 2-24h so that flour can absorb liquid, it does not gain much by absorbing egg, right? In this case, adding eggs shortly before baking will only have advantages (like increased food safety) and no disadvantages.


Yet, in all recipes, eggs are added in advance. What am I missing?

Why did my cod turn into a hockey puck,"I have a way of cooking cod loin which has never failed me before. This time, large parts of each loin became so rubbery as to be unchewable. I know several things that deviated from my usual recipe, but I'm wondering which thing was the culprit.


First, the recipe: Cod is dipped in milk and egg and then rolled in panko mixed with Cajun spices. A little olive oil is heated in a cast iron skillet. Cod is fried for a couple minutes on each side. Then the heat is turned to low and the lid is put on the skillet. The fish ""bakes"" in the cast iron for about 11 minutes. This has never failed to give me nice white flaky cod.


A couple things were different this time:


1. These were from a bag of frozen cod loins (maybe from Sam's Club or HEB.) These were the last two, so they'd been in the freezer a while.
2. I had gotten these last two out a couple weeks ago, and then didn't make the fish, so they went back into the freezer.
3. Instead of 11 minutes, they got more like 20 minutes of ""baking"".


On the first piece of fish, I took a bite off the end and it was fine. The next bite I couldn't cut with my fork. It was almost exactly the texture of that triangular piece of cartilage one gets on a chicken breast: rubbery, tough, bleh.


I would think that if over-baking were the problem, then the fish would have been tough at the ends, but the ends were the only edible bits. If it were that Sam's Club just stocks bad fish, then I'm incredibly unlucky/lucky in that out of a bag of 15 pieces, I chose two at a time over the months and only the last two were bad. That leaves ""refreezing."" Only these two pieces were thawed and then refrozen. Could that have caused the puck-ness?

Can you create brown butter directly from heavy cream?,"The other day I made cookies with homemade brown butter.


I first churned the butter from heavy cream, separating the butterfat from buttermilk. Then I took the remaining butter and melted it in a pan then browned the milk solids to make brown butter. Then I cool it in a glass container and let reform as a solid.


I am wondering if you could directly make brown butter by skipping the churning process for the heavy cream. Is there a way to heat heavy cream such that the water / buttermilk / etc. evaporates and leaves melted butterfat and milk solids?


I would think that the water would evaporate and leave only the butterfat + milk solids but I am not sure.




---


I had a pint of heavy cream so I went ahead and tried it to see what happens. I left in a small saucepan over medium / medium-low heat for a while with minor agitation (stirring every few minutes). It looked about the same for the first 45 minutes. Then I could actually start to see what I assume is the butterfat. However I also saw a large amount of milk solids (I assume), much larger than typical churned butter.


See oil + solids:


[![oil and solids](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Da7F9.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Da7F9.jpg)


Then I waited a little longer and it seems they separated further:


[![separated further](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UX7hL.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UX7hL.jpg)


A little longer and it smelled toasty like the usual smell from brown butter when I make it. I took it off the heat because it also ruined my pan pretty nicely. I poured it in a glass container and here's what it looks like after separating:


[![glass jar](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sKkTk.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sKkTk.jpg)


So my follow-up questions would be: Is this brown butter? Are the solids just milk solids or are they something else? Is the oil actually butterfat? Is this safe to incorporate into cookies as butter?


I enjoy the taste that toasted milk solids add to cookies but this is so much more milk solid than I was expecting (if it is milk solids).




---


Another update now that it's solidified. It looks and smells just like how my normal brown butter smells except it has way more milk solids (if that's what they are). I would estimate about 1/2 cup of clarified butter + slightly less than a half cup of toasted solids.


[![butter](https://i.stack.imgur.com/wc3Ad.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/wc3Ad.jpg)


It doesn't look like 1/2 cup clarified butter but keep in mind that the butter also settled into the gaps between the solids while it was still liquid.


[![milk solids](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cyiWl.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cyiWl.jpg)


It smells delicious. I'm tempted to soften it and mix it into a batch of cookies but I'm also not sure if the solids will be over powering in the taste.

Advice to making Boba Pearls,"Today, I tried 3 different ways to make boba/tapioca pearls from scratch, and while the third time sort of worked I never got a ""dough"" that was of a playdoh consistency.

* [Joshua Weissman Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_KKogWlndw)
* [Scientific American Article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/make-boba-for-bubble-tea/)
* [Instructables Article](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-make-Tapioca-Pearls-from-scratch/)


All use moderately different techniques, the essential technique appears to be:


* Mix hot water and tapioca starch together, in approximately correct proportions, and you will get a playdoh-like doh.


All three of our attempts were with boiling water with brown sugar, and varying degrees of tapioca.


The first two were horrible non-newtonian liquid pieces, that were impossible to form. i.e. once we stopped applying pressure they oozed everywhere but had zero pliability.


Our third attempt, we let the brown sugar and water boil for a while (but not to a syrupy consistency) and that seemed to do better. It was manipulatable, but definitely NOT ""playdoh"" like consistency. Additionally, after about 10 minutes it was hard as a rock. We found 10 seconds in the microwave helped make it moderately pliable again, but again, nothing close to the consistencies we were seeing described or observed in the videos.


I'd like suggestions on how to improve. Various thoughts that have come to mind include:


* Is there something wrong with our general approach here?
* Are there ""known"" techniques for getting the right consistency?
* Heat is pretty clearly important, is it just heat, or do proportions matter? Are there ""sweet spots"" in ratios of ingredients?
* Does heating a partially dissolved starch help? Some recipes do that, some don't. I haven't found a clear discussion of how different techniques help/hinder the process.

1 cup Grape Tomatoes, Halved


Do I measure out 1 cup of grape tomatoes and then cut each one in half? Or should I start cutting them in half and put all the half pieces into my measuring cup until it's full?


I can certainly fit more grape tomatoes into my measuring cup if they are all chopped in half than if they are whole.


I realize of course that most of the time the difference is probably too small to matter. But what if it *did* matter?

Does chocolate inhibit cornstarch gelatinization?,"I recently made chocolate pudding by putting 25ml of cream, 410ml of 3% milk and 50ml of cornstarch (not a good way to measure cornstarch, I know) along with two handfuls of [Callebaut milk chocolate](https://www.callebaut.com/en-OC/chocolate-cocoa-nuts/823nv/823) into the bowl of my Kenwood Cooking Chef, set it to constant slow stir (stirring speed 1) and set the cooking temperature (this stand mixer can cook in the bowl, while mixing) to 94 deg C. After a while I reduced the stirring speed to ""once in a while"" slow stir (stirring speed 3).


The result was really great but I wanted to redo it with even more chocolate to get a more saturated choccy flavour.


This time, same measurements, save for the choccy, of which I put in 169g, which seemed like more than double the last time.


This time I found out the gelatinization temperature of cornstarch is 60 deg C, so I set it to cook at 70 (just to be safe). It did not thicken at all. Thinking maybe it will after refrigeration I put it in the ol' fridge but all that happened was that a very thick surface coating was created. From experience with Creme Brûlée, I think it's the fat in the chocolate that accumulated and solidified at the top.


Put it in again in the bowl, added about 100ml more of starch and set it to stir at 68 deg C.


(BTW from experiments with the same starch and water I can, indeed, confirm it gelates at ~60 deg. C)


It's still cooking but I was wondering - is there some reason adding more chocolate made it harder for the starch to gelate?

Does preheating a pan before sautéing aromatics make a difference?,"Many recipes call for things like garlic and spices to be sautéed first before combining other ingredients into a pan. I have always preheated the oil in the pan first to get a good “sear”, but is it possible to achieve similar, or at least serviceable, results from starting the aromatics in a room temperature pan and oil?


I would consider doing this only for the added time flexibility. A slower start could allow me time to focus on a more intensive task elsewhere, without the risk of overheating the oil.

Identifying bulgur from cracked wheat,"In an excess of zeal to remain tidy (or to get tidy, rather), I discarded the bag and can no longer recall whether it was bulgur (bulgar, bulghur, ..) or cracked wheat.


[![bulgur or cracked wheat](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GezqQ.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GezqQ.jpg)


Cracked wheat is ""raw"". Bulgur is parboiled. Some recipes call for one; other recipes for the other.


How do I determine whether a particular container has bulgur or cracked wheat.


Possibly, the difference in use is small. Might one boil and adjust the cooking time by tasting (as if seeking some kind of *al dente*)?


**Conclusion**


Luckily the methods provided by Tesujin and by FuzzyChef give the same answer. It is bulgur. In an update I (or anyone) could post pictures comparing cracked wheat next to bulgur—perhaps with bright light to make the translucence evident. Meanwhile I'll check-mark Tetsujin's answer since it provides a method that anyone can use, not just me for this particular sample.

To flip or not to flip...? (a steak),"Some chefs say the steak cooks more evenly by flipping it often. Others say this makes the juices run out. With so many different styles and recipes out there, one must wonder: who is right?


What are the reasons one would flip a steak regularly or only once? Does the type of meat have any influence on this?


Also, why would flipping the steaks frequently (supposedly) make them cook more evenly? If both sides are exposed to the same heat for the same amount of time, what is the difference?

Adding fuel to a grill during long cooking,"I was thinking about cooking a whole chicken on the grill. This could take a couple of hours, and I might need to add some fuel to keep the heat going.

Is it safe, or advisable, to just add fresh briquettes during cooking?

Pre pan-fry marinaded meat before oven roasting?,"Probably the question's wording is not correct but here is what I wanted to ask:


I heard it several times that to avoid drying out the meat in the oven, it is advised to pan fry it to create a crust. Is it true for marinaded meat as well? I'm using livestock (pork, beef etc.), not poultry.

Oven is at the correct temperature but things are baking consistently slower than recipes suggest,"I have a weird issue  

I moved into a new house recently and I have some old oven in here I bought a thermometer which is hanged inside and it seems like the temperature is correct however, anything I put inside is not baking in the time it should.


For example I have cookies recipe that requires 160 degrees Celsius [=325f] for 10 min, but they are **still not fully baked after 17min at 350f** or ~22min on 325 [almost done though]  

Same for a **simple frozen pizza**. Instructions are 400 degrees for 18-21mins, but it is close to be done after 25+ mins. The cheese at the top is still not fully melted after that period.


It may sound weird but the only thing I can think of is the baking sheet.  

I have: *Nordic Ware Natural Aluminum Commercial Baker's Half Sheet, 2 pack, 2-Pack, Silver*


Maybe this is not the right sheet for baking and I should have ones from a different material and a different color [in my home country the sheets are black]  

For the cookies I also put them after they were in the freezer. **They should be cold while going into the oven, but maybe this is too cold and it contributed to the slow process**


UPDATE:  

Hey! So I checked and only the lower element is working. Here is the catch - The company is claiming that this is the baking element and the top element is the broiling, so only one of them will work at the time. Does this make sense to you all?

What are strategies to identify restaurants where you will learn as much as possible?,"How do I identify restaurants that offer excellent training/education? I considered looking at the number of chefs that learned at a certain restaurant and afterwards achieved a Michelin star or won prices etc. However, I could not find any database for this kind of information. Does such a database exist? If yes, would it be a good approach? I don't know many people in the culinary world who could recommend a suitable restaurant to me. As an alternative, is there some kind of forum with this kind of expertise? Maybe the chat of this site? Or is there a ranking of restaurants with regard to their educational quality?
If it matters, I am interested in restaurants in Europe, especially in Germany.


TLDR: What are strategies to identify restaurants where you will learn as much as possible?

Why did this gallon of milk stay fresh for so long?,"A few months ago I had a gallon of milk in the back of the fridge that stayed fresh for over a month - maybe even two; I lost track.


Our house is only me and my wife. We don't drink milk often. I use it more for recipes, and maybe an occasional iced coffee. Since I couldn't repeat this feat I have gone to half-gallons.


What I noticed about this gallon in particular is that its plastic container was more opaque than what we normally had been getting. Previously I was getting the supermarket brand with the semi-opaque plastic container. I had gotten this one, white, 100% opaque at another store.


I also thought maybe it had something to do with it being in the back of the fridge. Also, being packed in by other fridge mates. But this is something I have always tried to do.


Are there steps to try to get milk to last this long? Especially since I don't use it that often.


*Further Clarification:*


There seems to be some question about how spoilage was determined.


I have always and forever smelled my liquid dairy before using. I stand by my nose to let me know when such a product has gone too far. In some cases I have chosen to go a day or two beyond the onset of spoilage. This onset can be detected by a sweet-sour smell.


In the instance of this gallon I have posed above, there was no such indication in smelling the milk for at least a month beyond the Best By date. Of that I am sure. There was a period when I hadn't used it. After which I smelled it and it became obvious it was too far gone.

What are the safety and warranty implications of steaming bread in a domestic oven?,"There are lots of recipes online that suggest mimicking commercial bread ovens by using a water bath and or ice cubes to create a hot, steamy baking environment. I have always been very wary of doing this with my domestic electric oven for a number of reasons, and only spray my french loaves on top with a very fine water mist. The risks, as I see them, are as follows:


1. Potentially, any cooler water splashing on the hot glass oven door could cause it to shatter
2. Any steam penetration could have an adverse affect on the live circuit boards or controls causing them to malfunction e.g. a partial or full short circuit
3. The enamel coating and other parts of the oven itself etc. could be more liable to corrosion


Am I being too conservative here? I would think that if a domestic oven failed due to such usage, the manufacturer would refuse to repair it under a regular domestic warranty as the oven was not used according to the manual.

so


* q = 0.3 kg \* 2.72 kJ/(kg K) \* 100 K

From my experience, it takes longer than 82 seconds to heat up corn syrup that much.

What is a “small cup” in Australia and/or old recipes?,"In older or Australian recipes, is “small cup” a specific (if not quite standardized) measurement? If so, what, approximately, is that measurement?


I’m going to be making a recipe from an Australian cookbook this weekend, “Jet Age Cookbook… compiled by The Royal Australian Air Force Women’s Association”, circa 1969-1976.


The recipe calls for “1 small cup boiling water”. This is a sauce that is basically a syrup, so I suspect that the water content does not need to be exact. I plan to use ½ cup. I’m also aware that in older recipes, measurements such as spoons, teaspoons, and cups (and in some countries such as Australia, dessert spoons) weren’t necessarily standardized but could refer to the various tableware the cook happened to have on hand. In those cases, however, they are referring to specific measurements even if it isn’t a standardized measurement—a spoon used for tea, a spoon used for dessert, a half of a specific cup (it makes little sense to call for half of a random cup out of the cupboard). I’m wondering if “small cup” is also a specific measurement, whether a standardized one or not.


It’s difficult to do a search on merely “small cup”, but I did find a few references in older recipes (that they’re older is not necessarily indicative of anything: I added “vintage recipes” to the search in an attempt to weed out mere references to smaller drinking vessels).


In some older recipes, a small cup does (to me at least) clearly refer merely to a smaller drinking vessel. These [Martha’s Vineyard Hermits](https://archive.vcstar.com/lifestyle/you-wont-want-to-hide-these-hermits-ep-368214561-348769961.html/), for example, tell the cook “In a small cup, stir the sour cream and baking soda to mix well”.


Others seem to refer to a specific measurement. In [Mrs. Edison’s Old Fashioned Recipe for Chocolate Caramels](https://www.edisonfordwinterestates.org/mrs-edisons-old-fashioned-recipe-for-chocolate-caramels/) I found the only reference that might be a clue as to the size of a small cup. It calls for “1 small cup of butter (size of an egg)”. If that’s the approximate size of a “small cup”, even my ½ cup estimate may be too much.


But one reference is difficult to base a philosophy on.


I did a search for “small cup” limited to the Internet Archive, and found the reference in several very old cookbooks.


* The 1809 [Complete Confectioner](https://archive.org/details/b21530658) has a recipe for Naple’s biscuits that calls for “one small cup full of orange flower water”.
* The 1895 [Universalist Social Circle Cook Book](https://archive.org/details/usccookbookcompf00scot) has a recipe for coffee bread that takes “1 small cup butter”, a recipe each for crumb pie and corn oysters that take “1 small cup flour”, a recipe for graham pudding that calls for “1 teaspoonful soda dissolved in small cup milk”, and, very interestingly, a recipe for steamed roly-poly pudding that calls for “nearly a small cup milk”. If “small cup” was another way of saying a scant cup (another of my guesses), this is a very odd phrasing.
* The 1908 [Council Cook Book](https://archive.org/details/cu31924085804767) has a recipe for fruit icing wafers that calls for “One small cup of sugar”, and a recipe for leb-kuchen that calls for “one small cup each of chopped nuts and citron”.
* The 1909 [Recipes of the Woman’s Club of San Mateo](https://archive.org/details/recipeswomansclu00womaiala) has a recipe for onion cream soup that says “Put small cup of cream in a heated soup-tureen…”.
* The 1910 [Magnolia Cook Book](https://archive.org/details/magnoliacookbook00losaiala) has a sponge cake recipe that calls for “another small cup sugar” and a fig cake that calls for “1 small cup butter”. It also has one recipe that calls for “a small ½ cup of sugar”. This might indicate that small refers to the opposite of heaping, similar to a scant cup, but that doesn’t seem to fit all of these recipes. And in my particular recipe, a scant cup of water would seem to me to be a lot (see below).


While some of these references seem as if they could be just saying “a little bit of”, **others do seem to use the phrase “small cup” to reference something reasonably specific. It seems unlikely, for example, that a recipe would call for “*nearly* a small cup milk” if they’re just calling for a random small cup from the cupboard. Am I reading that right? What is the likely range of measurements if so?**


I’m asking for an answer for either older recipes in general or for Australian recipes in particular because other research I did involving teaspoons, tablespoons, and cups indicated that measurements tended to be similar, though not exact, throughout the United States, Great Britain, Canada, and Australia before standardization. While I would prefer to know what a small cup is in this particular Australian recipe, I will accept knowing what a small cup used to be within the core Anglosphere.


Note: *Jet Age Cookbook* does not mention a year; I’m estimating the age via addresses in the advertisements in the book: two businesses used addresses of shopping malls that opened 1968 and 1969, and another business’s address diverged from the address they used in this book in 1976. The book itself seems like it ought to be older, to my American eyes. From the two-color cover, the cover font, and the interior typing, to the near-universal use of “moderate oven”, “hot oven”, or “slow oven”, it seems more like what I’d expect from the fifties.


Note: I’m also aware, from looking up the definition of dessert spoons, that the modern Australian tablespoon is four teaspoons, not three.

It comes with a little measuring cylinder for the amount of water to add which has gradations that look something like:



```

- 4
- 5
- 6/7

- 3
- 4

I understand why more water is required to hard boil eggs compared to medium cooked eggs (they need to be cooked longer).


However, I don't understand the gradations within each range (the number of eggs to be cooked).


Why does, for example, cooking 1 medium egg require **more** steam than cooking 3 medium eggs? Surely it should be the other way around?


Can someone enlighten me?

In my country, Bulgaria, we call it ""live"" yeast, despite that both kinds of yeast sold here are actually live. The other kind sold here (called ""dry"" yeast) is sold in little packets of 7 or 10g and inside it looks like a lot of tiny cillindrical thingies with tiny holes in them. I always thought those are the yeast creatures, themselves, but it might be a way of packing them.


Anyway, since there isn't much information about such things on the Bulgarian internet I want to look things up on the English-speaking one but I don't know if the yeast in the pictures is what you'd call ""instant"" yeast, as it doesn't look anything like what I've seen on the 'net for it.


The reason I want to know what it would be called in English is that I want to know if there is any difference in the bread product depending on the type of yeast used. From all I've read, both in ENG and BUL 'nets, the only difference between the ""live"" and ""dry"" yeast (""instant"" and whatever the other kind was called) was that you have to ""activate"" one kind and you can straight up use the other kind right off the bat.

Would adding them into the pot with the rice later than most recipes call for work well? Since that would result in them cooking for less time.

Kimchi air bubble removal,"I'm making Kimchi for the first time and I have two questions about air bubble removal.


First, all the recipes I've seen say to press the Kimchi down to remove air bubbles.

**Should I also try to remove new/larger bubbles as they form during fermentation?** I.e. by pushing deeper into the jar with a muddler. Or does doing so risk contaminating the environment with new external bacteria?

Can falafel be made using previously frozen chickpeas?,"Many falafel recipes caution against using canned chickpeas. For example, [this recipe has this to say about using canned chickpeas for falafel](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/how-to-make-falafel/):

Are the oats in overnight oats processed differently by milk than by milk substitutes?,"I've read some recipes/blogs that say that overnight oats can be made with milk substitutes such as almond milk. Other recipes/blogs I've read say that enzymes found in milk help to break down the oats, which allows for the long soaking process to serve as an alternative to cooking them with high heat.


Clearly many people make overnight oats using milk substitutes, so it works to some extent, but does using actual milk make a notable difference in how the oats end up? Does the choice between milk versus milk substitute affect their nutritional profiles (as one can break down more/different substances in them than the other)? Does the choice between milk versus milk substitute affect their texture?


Perhaps the claims about enzymes in milk being important for the oats are simply incorrect. After all, processing techniques commonly used for milk (e.g. heat treatment) destroys/deactivates many of the enzymes in milk.

Getting even heat on a gas stove,"I am cooking on gas stoves very seldomly, mostly in some hotel/airbnb's with a small personal kitchen. I often have this problem: the gas comes out in a ring of blue flames. I think more expensive stoves may have more than one concentric ring, but the ones I encountered always had only one circle of small flames.


If I put a large pot or pan on a large circle, then it seems to me that the outside portions of the pot are heated much more strongly than the center due to the direct contact with the flames.


If I put a large pot on a small circle, it seems more even as the gas hits the center first but then flows outwards more or less uniformly. But the small stove then usually does not have enough oomph to heat a big pot efficiently.


How do you do this? Is it just as I noticed, and there is no real solutions? Would a really good gas stove always have concentric rings and thus a more even heat distribution? Or is there some other technique to work around it?

Could you tell me who is correct?



> 
> Agitation causes the little bunches of proteins in the white to unfold, at which point the individual molecules start to collect around air bubbles and bond with each other. If there’s salt in the mix that bonding process is slowed as the salt dissolves into its component parts — sodium and chloride — and those ions start to adhere to the bonding sites on the protein molecules, preventing the proteins from using those sites to bond with each other. The result is that the foam takes longer to whip up and is less stable when it finally does form.

Wild Sourdough Starter Never gets more than 1/3 bigger - Am I doing something wrong?,"I made a wild sourdough starter back in July of last year. Did some baking with it, but it has never doubled in size the way that I see described in articles online.


I initially started it with all-purpose flour and aired-out tap water, but I've moved it to Bread Flour and Spring water. At best, I'll see it increase in volume by roughly 1/3.


I keep the Sourdough Starter in a pair of Ball Wide-Mouth pint jars, and feed the starter twice per day. The method I've been following for the past month has been:


* Stir the sourdough starter thoroughly.
* Pour 2 oz (56g) by weight from the old jar to the new jar.
* Add 2 oz of spring water by weight to the new jar. Stir thoroughly.
* Add 2 oz of Gold Medal bread flour by weight. Stir thoroughly.
* Mark time and initial level on new jar.
* Cover with two coffee filters, and screw the lid rim on to hold them there, and allow for outgassing.
* Lay the lid insert on top to reduce drying.
* Wash the old jar to get it ready for use as the new jar in the next feeding


Temperatures in the apartment are typically about 75-80°F by day, 80-85 by night. Starter typically peaks in 8-12 hours,

The recipe specifies 2 refrigeration steps: one overnight, the other for 2 hours (overnight for the boudin, 2 hours for the rolled boudin balls before deep-frying). From what I understand, this is so that the balls don't explode when deep-frying, because there's a lot of moisture in them (although I don't understand how the freezing helps - they will cook through completely anyway, right?).


I was wondering whether the refrigeration times can be shortened - less time, and also by using the freezer. [This post](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/64314/how-to-keep-boudin-blood-sausage-slices-from-disintegrating-when-pan-frying) seems to hint at it being possible (?)


Beginner cook, so would appreciate any advice and explanation!

Am I calculating bread dough hydration correctly?,"I know this seems like it should be obvious; calculating bread dough hydration isn't rocket science.
My recipe is 600 g of flour, 270 g of water, 57 g of butter, 46 g of honey, 1.5 tsp of salt, 2 tsp of yeast. Salt and yeast are in tsp because at those light weights, there's a significant difference in volume in fractional grams but the idea is 6g of yeast and 7g of salt.


I've read that butter and honey both have about 18% water so I add that to the water and I end up with 48% hydration. Everything I read says this is way too low. The dough in the bread machine seems very moist and is quite sticky. I used a batch for making hamburger buns, using the dough cycle, and it was so sticky and wet I couldn't work with it. But baked in the machine, the bread comes out pretty good, rising to within 1/2 inch of the machine lid and it holds up well to slicing, sandwiches, etc.


So, what gives? Is my calculation wrong or is there some reason I'm succeeding at 48% and, at 48%, the dough is very wet and sticky?


I also make sour dough bread at higher hydration, about 60%, without the breadmaker but it is never as sticky as the bread machine recipe - using the same flour. The flour is Montana All Purpose Flour - a premium flour sold at Walmart.


Is this experience normal or am I doing, measuring, calculating, something wrong?

Cooling coffee rapidly without dilution,"I like iced coffee when the weather is hot, and I like to drink it black (or nearly black) and undiluted. What is a good setup for cooling freshly brewed coffee quickly, without a lot of hassle? I'm talking about normal brewed coffee, not cold brew.


At Starbucks, they seem to put ice in your cup and then pour coffee directly over the ice. This works, but it uses a lot of ice, and by the time you're done drinking it, the melting ice has started to dilute the coffee. You also just can't fit very much coffee in a cup this way, because so much space is taken up by the ice.


I've tried putting a whole bunch of water in a big pan, then sticking a thin-walled metal cup in the water and pouring the coffee into the cup to cool. This cools the coffee rapidly at first, but then the cooling process gets extremely slow. I think part of the problem is that the conduction and convection processes are slow, and also that the water's heat capacity isn't super huge, compared to the heat of melting of ice.


I homebrew beer, and to cool my wort, I have a coil of copper tubing that I insert into the pot and run water through from a garden hose. This is pretty efficient, but works for a quantity orders of magnitude greater than a cup of coffee. It uses a huge amount of water.


Below is a method that I'm currently messing around with. The pan of water is to take the initial heat off of the coffee and make sure the coffee is cool enough so that I don't melt a hole through the plastic parts or release bad chemicals into the coffee from the plastic. I then put some ice in the ziplock bag and stick it in. After a few minutes I can take the cup out of the pan. The ice melts, and then I replace it with fresh ice. This setup seems not too bad, but still kind of slow and wasteful. It uses up a lot of ice. I can wash and reuse the bag.


[![cooling coffee](https://i.stack.imgur.com/z9sj0.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/z9sj0.jpg)


Is there a better way to do this? I'm fantasizing about weird gadgets such as an aquarium pump sending pre-chilled vodka or ice water through a closed loop of tubing. Or maybe putting pieces of brass or copper in the freezer.

For what dishes I should wash starch off red lentils?,"I usually wash grains and beans before using them. I wonder how/for what dishes I should wash red lentils?


When I washed them, the water looks ""soapy"" (lots of foam) until I change it cr. 8 times.
According to [this blog](https://chezmoiblog.com/2012/08/23/how-to-wash-lentils/), this is a correct procedure, I should wash the lentils until the water runs clean (i.e. no foam).
But obviously, it takes time, and starch (?) is sometimes beneficial for the dishes.


So my question is: for what dishes I should wash red lentils until the water becomes clean, and for what I should wash just once or twice, to wash off the dust?

What kind of butter do restaurants like olive garden use for their pasta?,"I am trying to make pasta at home that tastes like Olive Garden pasta (which I have with butter instead of alfredo). I believe that the reason that my pasta doesn't taste the same is because of the butter I use. I use Land of Lakes salted butter and I noticed that when I add the butter to the pasta the butter isn't very visible vs. when Olive Garden uses butter it becomes a darker yellow liquid that ends up tasting much better. What brands of butter do restaurants like Olive garden use? Or is there something special they do to the butter to make it taste better (I just add 5 tablespoons of the butter to a pound of pasta after I take it out of the strainer and then I mix the pasta).

Oven management in restaurants,"Background: I'm an ERP consultant and one of my customers is a metal works factory in which they have an oven. This is an expensive piece of hardware so they have only one oven. It is important to schedule the jobs that use the oven in order to use it as efficiently as possible.


And now to the question: after cooking my lunch of baked fish, I wonder how restaurants manage their oven/s. Do they have only one oven, using it for all dishes, and filling and emptying at 15 minute intervals (or similar)? Do they have several ovens and somehow manage which dishes (for which diners) are in which ovens, and at what time the dishes entered the oven?

Any success with gumbo in an Instant Pot?,"I love cooking my grandmother's seafood gumbo recipe, and I have done this successfully many times. Recently, my husband suggested we try this in the Instant Pot to save time with the roux, which I did not advise.


There are many questions about roux [here](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/search?q=roux). We have tried similar gumbo [recipes](https://www.paintthekitchenred.com/best-instant-pot-gumbo/) twice specified for the Instant Pot, and it's just not the same. His impression was that the high-heat of sauteeing to make roux in the Instant Pot for less time (10 minutes) yields the same result as doing this on the stove top for longer (30 minutes). Both times, our gumbo was the consistency of light soup, and it did not thicken.


The roux was not the same consistency as when we've done this on the stove-top. It was not smooth and a much lighter color than a dark roux. I suspect the constant high-heat can be problematic for a roux. **Was it the roux (or lack of a dark roux) from the Instant Pot or cooking in the Instant Pot in general?**


I might just be a purest and skeptical of the Instant Pot for some dishes to believe that a good gumbo and roux are just not the same with this method. Has anyone had success cooking gumbo or roux in this vessel?

Bread maker paddle cylinder bored round; inner flat side gone,"I have a Zojirushi BB-PAC20 two-paddle bread maker. It had been working fine for years, but recently it stopped mixing right, leaving huge chunks of unmixed flour. I found that the problem was one of the paddles; it rotated freely all the way around the post it mounts on, so when bread ingredients were there holding it in place, the post would have rotated freely within the cylinder, without rotating the paddle.


Originally the cylinder had a flat side, matching the flat side of the post it mounts on and which rotates the paddle. The paddle's cylinder had been bored completely smooth and round; no vestige of the flat side.


The other paddle had only a tiny nub remaining from the flat side; it would have failed in the same way soon.


My question is, what happened to the metal that had constituted the inner flat side of the cylinder? I'm pretty sure we didn't eat bits of metal, and I never saw bits of metal when cleaning out the pan and paddles between loaves. Where did that metal go?

Storing spoiled meat with fresh meat in a freezer,"I just bought a new chest freezer to store some lamb and beef. I placed the fresh lamb meat in a couple of metal containers (not covered) and put these in the freezer. I did the same with the beef but in different containers (not covered) and put them into the same freezer. However, after already dropping a couple of the beef containers in the freezer, I noticed a pungent smell of spoiled beef coming out of the one last container.


I immediately opened the freezer and removed the other beef containers out of it. They must have been in there for like 5-10 minutes tops. The thing is that the freezer is ridden with the rancid smell of spoiled meat and it just doesn't seem to go away. The lamb is fresh and unspoiled. But that's what I'm worried about: if that spoiled batch of beef had an effect on the lamb and spoiled it as well.


Can that happen? Can you spoil fresh meat in a freezer by putting spoiled meat next to it in the same freezer (in uncovered separate vessels/containers, of course)? Or is it just the smell of that spoiled batch of meat and nothing to worry about?

Mimicking Lipton's Green Diet Iced Tea Citrus,"My girlfriend is absolutely obsessed with this bottled tea, Green Diet Iced Tea Citrus. Personally I think it's kind of gross, but I don't really like tea to begin with. That's personal taste for you.


I purchased a huge amount of the stuff for her to drink while she was visiting, and it's only during the aftermath that I realized just how much unnecessary plastic I was having to deal with. I tried looking around, but Lipton doesn't sell a powdered version (which would produce far less waste) of the Diet product and probably be cheaper to boot.


I'm a pretty stubborn person though, so I figured I'd take my own swing at it. How hard could it be, right?


They have the ingredients for their Citrus Green Iced Tea Powder Mix listed on their [website](https://smartlabel.unileverusa.com/041000002267-0001-en-US/index.html#ingredients) (the non-diet version, anyway) which consists rather simply of:


* Cane Sugar
* Citric Acid
* Green Tea Powder
* ""Natural Flavor""
* Soy Lecithin


Okay, easy enough. I also know that the Diet version uses Aspartame instead of Cane Sugar. A closer inspection of the Ingredients label on the Diet indicates it has some Ascorbic acid, too.


So I went out and bought some **Equal, Green Tea Powder, Ascorbic Acid, and Citric Acid. Added on some Lime and Lemon juice for those ""natural flavors"", whatever that means.**


I left out the Soy Lecithin because my research indicated it was an anti-clumping measure, which I don't think I'd need with separate ingredients?


I'm not sure how to feel about the ingredients I've assembled, nor do I really have much of a clue on what ratios to use here. I want the prep for this to be a surprise so I can do a blind taste test with my girlfriend, but the drink tastes awful to me to begin with, so I don't know if I'm the best judge of similarity between the two. I'm willing to just bang it out through repeated attempts, but **maybe somebody here would know a good starting point for how much of each ingredient to mix in?**

Is there a way predict proving times of dough (without experience)?,"I make homemade pizza dough and other breads and baked goods quite regularly, but only have started to do so recently. One of the issues I have run into is that recipes always come with their own recommended proving times, some with better results than others.


The issue I have run into is that I want to be able to vary my proving times to be longer or shorter depending on how much time I have between kneading and baking. I have found that longer proving times often lead to nicer flavours (especially with pizza dough), and would like to maximise the time I have. However, I have no idea how to go about this. Without the experience of a seasoned veteran, I don't know how much more or less yeast to add to get the proving time to fit the amount of time I have.


I realise this depends on various factors (heat of the environment, heat of the yeast water, etc.) which make it more unpredictable, but I can keep these factors fairly the same with a constant temperature at all times. Is there a way to tell how much I should vary the yeast, which doesn't consist of me making every recipe I know three times with varying degrees of yeast to see what happens?

Can I season a wok on an induction cooktop?,"I just got a new wok and realized that I have no idea how to go about seasoning it on my induction cooktop. It's a flat-bottom, carbon steel wok, so I don't have to worry about contact on the bottom, but my concern is how do I get the sides?


The one idea I had was to season the bottom of the pan as normal, and then heat a neutral oil and something like sliced onions until they caramelize or char and push them up the sides to distribute the seasoned oil, then discarding the oil/onions and repeating. I'm not sure how effective this would be, and it seems like it would take a *lot* of repetitions (5+) and waste a lot of oil (and onions; but oil is harder to dispose of.)


My old wok I seasoned on a gas stove, but where I currently live I don't know anyone who has a gas stove -- most everyone has electric. I don't think seasoning it in the oven like cast iron is an option; I'm pretty sure at least one of the wooden elements isn't detachable.

Preventing flash rust after tempering a carbon steel wok,"After just 2 days of using my new carbon steel wok pan, I noticed something suspicious inside it:


[![Burnt oil?](https://i.stack.imgur.com/U57LG.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/U57LG.jpg)


Looking back on it, it was probably just burnt oil and nothing to worry about. However, I mistook it for rust, and began my arduous journey to get rid of it. (Let me know what you think it was and what to think of it in the future, please)


First I scoured the spots with water and plastic scouring wool, then added some dishwashing liquid and continued the process, but it had practically no effect on the spots even after tens of minutes of work. Eventually I just chose to nuke the pan and start the seasoning process all over again.


I decided to try soaking the pan in acid and filled it up with water, adding some grams of citric acid into the mix. After some 20 minutes of waiting and haphazard scrubbing, the inside of the pan looked shiny enough for me even though there were still some bits of crud left. I removed the acidic solution and, just to be safe, filled the pan with water and some grams of baking soda in order to neutralize the acid. (Looking back, I do not think this was enough)


After that, following the guidance of numerous internet guides (e.g. [1](https://thewoksoflife.com/how-to-season-a-wok/), [2](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RB67OAJ9IOLY9)), I wanted to temper the wok again. I assumed that the protective oxide layer formed while bluing the pan for the first time had been erased along with the rest of the seasoning.


However, after I had blued the pan and waited a couple of minutes for it to cool down, a horrible sight awaited me:


[![Flash rust?](https://i.stack.imgur.com/wAWcP.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/wAWcP.jpg)


I am almost certain that this was rust—the infamous flash rust.


I was petrified. Too demotivated to start the process all over again, I tried to season the pan, hoping that the ""rust"" was just a harmless byproduct of the bluing process. (Though I had not seen it when tempering the pan earlier)


This ended just about as well as anyone could expect:


[![...](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GLPhW.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GLPhW.jpg)


I had clearly botched the seasoning. In hindsight, I think I may have tried to polymerize the thin coat of rapeseed oil over heat too high.


Thus, my main problem is as follows: how do I prevent flash rust from appearing after tempering the pan? I quite clearly cannot just rub oil on it to protect it while it's at 350 degrees celsius (≈660°F)... Do I just have to cool it down really quickly with water? Also, what caused it? Acid residue?


In general, how should I proceed? Can I, or should I, even repeat the bluing process again while reseasoning the pan? How acidic should the initial nuking solution be; is more acid better, or less?

I've tried some of those gadgets where you place pieces of veggies and they are diced, but the ones I've tried are flimsy for the use I give them they last a few months, is there a top of the line brand that can withstand the test of time and hard vegetables (like sweet potatoes or eggplant)?


I imagine that the other option would be to perfect my cutting technique to be as proficient as a chef. Would you recommend a resource to learn how to cut like a chef?


So, to sum up, can you suggest creative ways to speed that part up?

How should red wine be used in Spaghetti Bolognese?,"The classic Spaghetti Bolognese recipe adds red wine right at the beginning to the fried minced beef until its all absorbed with little liquid remaining. In theory, this makes sense to me in enhancing the flavour of the beef, yet I can't taste any difference: it still tastes 100% beefy to me. On the other hand, it does add a red-wine flavour to the sauce if its added at the end into the whole simmering mixture. Yet the recipe also adds beef stock to the simmering mixture which then clashes with the red wine, so its purpose is confusing to me.

(How) Have I ruined my titanium pan?,"I have a Zwilling Forte titanium pan with a five-layer T-Ix non-stick coating (which I understand is just the name of the titanium Layers). According to description it's supposed to be super durable (even using metal utensils; that's why I bought it) and suitable for oven up to 250 °C. It's just over a year old and so far I was very happy with it.


Recently it's started to lose the non-stick qualities. I noticed some black spots as well as scratches. I have to admit I'm not very good at caring for it properly so I wondered if it's just burned-on food.


I couldn't get it off, so I was googling how to clean very burned on food. I used just soap (Amway dish drops) and hot water. The final attempt was sodium percarbonate and some boiling water. I was scraping with a plastic spatula. The water came out pretty brown and now it reveals what appears to be peeled-off spots (see picture), and quite a lot of them.


[![Pan with spots showing](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mMp8O.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mMp8O.jpg)

It's been used a lot in the year, cooking basically everything, including acidic foods. It's been used in the oven quite a bit too.


I noticed some minor scratching after my first use of a metal spoon, but nothing too bad and it still worked pretty well.


Can I still use this safely? Should/can I season it like a cast-iron one to make it work again?

"Will using a stick blender 'chop up' the gluten in my Yorkshire pudding/crepe batter? If so, does it matter?","I've always made Yorkshire puddings and pancakes using a stick blender. I'll typically make the batter, leave it to stand for an hour or so and give it one last whizz about 5 minutes before pouring it into the tins/pan as appropriate.


My flatmate saw me making them for the first time, and was horrified. He thinks I should use a wooden spoon so I don't 'chop up' the gluten and affect the rise. My Yorkshire puddings always rise well and are light, so I'm tempted to stick to my easy speedy method.


My thoughts are that the gluten won't really have formed into chains when I first blend it, so there's nothing to chop up. I'm prepared to concede that it might in the second, but because it's a wet batter you don't really have the same sort of network as you would in a dough. I've looked at recipes and have found a few people (including Mary Berry and Delia Smith) who use an electric whisk, which I would think would also be quite robust, but I suppose it doesn't have blades in the same way.


So, is there any evidence that using a stick blender would

"Why do some products have different nutritional composition stated on different containers, even when accounting for serving size?","I've been looking into nutritional composition of beverages and I've found something weird: sometimes, when the same product is served in a different container, the nutritional contents on on the packaging changes even though it's supposed to be the same beverage. And yes, I am accounting for serving size. For example, from the Dutch website of my local grocery store:


* [Lipton Original sparkling ice tea served in containers of .15 liters](https://www.delhaize.be/nl-be/shop/Dranken-en-alcohol/Frisdrank/Iced-tea/Original/Bruisende-Ijsthee-Original-12x15-cl/p/S2019030600181570099) say they contain 4.5 grams of sugar per 100 ml and 20 kilocalories;

My assumption was always that in the factories that produce and bottle these beverages, they make these in giant vats of thousands of liters and then assign part to the .15 liter containers and part to the 1.5 liter containers. If this is the case, then why do these contain such massively different nutritional value differences?

How do you properly and consistently pan-sear shrimp?,"Anytime I attempt to pan-sear shrimp, I struggle to achieve a perfect char. I typically turn the stove on high, pre-heat a stainless steel pan, use butter + olive oil, and then add the shrimp for a couple minutes each side.

I find after a few minutes each side, the shrimp are done but not charred or crisp, but if cooked much longer, the shrimp become too well done.

Had my frozen hot dogs gone rancid?,"Where I live is currently in Covid lockdown, so when I was cooking dinner tonight, I decided to pull some old hot dogs out of my freezer and boil them. However, rather than sinking to the bottom of the pot, they floated, and during the boiling process, a sort of yellow foam could be seen coming off of them through holes in their skin. Finally, when I removed them from the pot after they'd been boiled, I noticed that they were unusually firm, and when I cut one open, the meat (or fat?) inside had gotten a bit of a yellowish hue.


When I checked the packaging, I saw that they'd had a best before date of 2019. While they had been in the freezer that entire time, and had never been defrosted, so I didn't have to worry about them going bad from bacterial growth, but I remember hearing that frozen meat can go rancid from oxidation over time.


Is this what happened to my hot dogs? If so, would they have been safe to eat? Is there any way to tell if frozen meat is starting to go rancid, so that it can be eaten before it goes fully inedible? I figured ""better safe than sorry"" and threw them in the rubbish bin, and made myself something else to eat instead, but now I'm sort of wondering about what I should do in the future if this recurs.

Is my wild yeast starter a throwaway or salvageable?,"I followed this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wTt8VGyBdk) to make a wild yeast starter. My intention is to use them for making bread, hamburger buns, and maybe even try them out in a 1-gallon experimental homebrew!


The TLDR; of that video is:


1. Mix 3 tbsp flour + 3 tbsp pineapple juice into a mason jar and lightly cover
2. Whisk every few hours for the first 24 hrs
3. Then, starting at the 24-hr/1-day mark, add another mixture of 3 tbsp flour + 3 tbsp distilled water every day, for 4 more days
4. By the end of the 5th day, you should have a vigorous yeast starter, foaming with lots of bubbles




---


So I followed this and I am now on Day 5, and I see 2 problems:


* Although I do see lots of tiny bubbles on the surface of the starter, and it smells doughy/malty/toasty, it doesn't look as ""bubbly"" as the mason jar on that video. It looks like I'm not even half-way to where the jar in that video was at by Day 5. So I'm not sure if my yeast is activated enough to be useful for baking.
* Every time I added flour + water, I mixed it in, and accidentally scraped/wiped the fork off on the inside of the jar, above the starter. So over the course of a few days, there's been ""wipe off residue"" clinging to the side of the jar several inches about the starter. Well, I am now seeing little bits of mold forming on the wipe off (that my fork left behind), which got caked on to the upper part of the jar. I'm guessing this happened because, whereas there's enough yeast down in the starter to fight off any bacterial/mold infection, there's not enough of it up on the caked on ""wipe off"" parts higher up in the jar. So mold is being allowed to form up there. **Not much, but visible.**


So I ask:


How can I tell when I have either enough yeast, or enough ""active"" yeast to use for baking, and is it safe to transfer the non-infected (not moldy) starter from my one mason jar to another, clean one?

Riddle: Deciphering (likely) wrong Nutritional Info,"I bought some ""Keto-Ice Cream"" a few days ago, and I have been since questioning the trustworthiness of its Nutritional Facts. I would like some help to decipher them, as there is either something I am missing, or they are simply wrong.


First, these are the ingredients as written in the packaging (in the same order).


**Cocoa Ice Cream**: Water, Erythritol, Polydextrose, Low-fat Cocoa Powder (7%), Sunflower Oil, Mono- and Diglycerides of Fatty Acids, Locust Bean Gum, Guar Gum, Carrageenan, Sunflower Lecithin.


And this is the corresponding Nutritional Table (both for 100g of product).





| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Energy | 34Kcal |
| Fat | 6g |
| - of which Saturated | 1.3g |
| Protein | 10g |
| Carbohydrates | 15g |
| - of which sugars | <0.5g |
| - of which polyols | 13.5g |
| Fiber | 11g |



Looking at these, I think that at least one of the following statements is correct:


* The ingredients are wrong (either in their order, or in the actual items)
* The Energy (KCal) is wrong
* The macronutrients values are wrong


**MY QUESTIONS**:


1. How is the reported ""Energy"" value possible with the given macronutrients?
2. Looking at the ingredients, how are the reported macronutrients values possible?


For instance, the *nutritional facts* reports 6g of fat, and since 1g of fat = 9Kcal, then this macronutrient alone should provide 54KCal, which is already above the reported value (34 KCal). I even question the validity of 6g of fats in the finished product by going over the *ingredients*: the only ingredients in that list that contain fat are the cocoa powder (which only amounts to 7% of the finished product, and low-fat cocoa powder has less than 20% fat) and the sunflower oil (which, being mentioned AFTER the cocoa powder, must be less than 7% of the whole product despite being 100% fat). Hence, unless the Sunflower Oil represents, say, 6% of the product, then I do not understand how it is possible for the finished product to have 6g of fat.


The same can be said for the Protein value: 10g of protein=40KCal>34KCal. And how are 10g of protein possible from those ingredients?


**ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS** assuming that either the nutritional table or the ingredient list are wrong:


1. what should be a (possible) Nutritional Table if the ingredients are correct?
2. what should be the (possible) ingredients list if the Nutritional Table is correct?

How to make (vegan) cheese saltier?,"I have recently been making some quick vegan cheeses such as paneer and halloumi with similar methods to making the dairy version of these cheeses. The process I'm following is roughly:


1. Blend softened/soaked nuts with water and strain to create a creamy plant milk.
2. Bring milk to the boil, then immediately remove from heat and add coagulant (lemon, vinegar, etc.).
3. Gather curds in cheese cloth and press/chill until firm enough.


That is typically followed by various types of brining/other cooking/etc. depending on the style of cheese.


The cheese has actually been coming out really well, but I feel lacks saltiness. I have tried things like covering in cheese salt for storage, brining, etc. but I find this hasn't really helped. I would like the actual cheese itself to be saltier. As I have only been using plant milk I'm not sure whether this lack of saltiness is something that also happens with dairy milk or not.

Substitute for Tomato Paste in Lentil Soup,"​
I've been making a tried-and-true lentil soup recipe for many years and I now for dietary reasons have to eliminate one ingredient, tomato paste (or any tomato at all). I've tried a few substitutions but have yet to get the depth of flavor I get from the tomato paste.


Here's how I make it.
10 cups water
About 8 tsp. chicken base
1.5 cups lentils
Aromatics: onion, garlic
Spices/herbs: dried thyme, dried basic, bay leaf, ground pepper, salt
Vegetables: carrots, celery, green cabbage,
About 1/4 c tomato paste was added at the end.
Parsley or other greens are usually thrown in at the end.


I've tried two substitutions, neither being adequate:


* soy sauce: added 1/4 cup
* mushrooms (1.5 lbs sliced crimini cooked down with resulting broth part of the 10 cups liquid)


What other substitutions for tomato paste would give good depth of flavor to this soup?

Sparkling strawberries in glass,"I made several glasses of whole strawberries in syrup. Normally I do this:


1. sterilize the glass and the screw cap with boiling water
2. carefully wash and sort strawberries
3. make a syrup 300g of sugar to 0.5l of boiling water
4. put strawberries into glass and pour the syrup on them leaving approx 1cm from the cap
5. put the glass to the electric oven - 100°C for 30 minutes


Then I store them in the refrigerator and usually they are OK.


However this time the first 2 glasses were ""strange"" - when I open them the gas comes out and the syrup is sparkling. Also the strawberries are sparkling inside. The taste is very good, like sparkling water with strawberry syrup. No sour or bitter.


I think some fermentation processes started. I read the similar question [Lemon liqueur has gas?](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/96828/lemon-liqueur-has-gas) and I think that the case is similar. However I used no alcohol.


The question(s):


1. Are the strawberries and syrup safe?
2. Can you speculate the reasons why the fermentation process started and suggest what to do to prevent such process in the future?

How to cook kale and collard greens for someone who doesn't like them?,"My farmshare vege box is forcing me to confront my least favourite vegetables. I have disliked kale and collard greens when I had them previously because of their bitterness and tough texture. Are there ways of cooking which minimizes these? I have previously tried:


* Raw in salad (too bitter, too tough)
* Sauteed (still too bitter and too tough), maybe I did it wrong?
* In soup, I tried kale as a substitute for spinach in a beef-noodle soup. Toughness decreased after I boiled it for an hour+, but my entire soup became bitter, which I resented.


I've heard kale chips is a possibly promising option -- does baking get rid of the bitterness? I would prefer other suggestions as I was hoping to have them as part of a meal (instead of as a snack).


In general I love a variety of different vegetables, and these two are the only ones I've struggled with, so I was wondering if it ultimately came down to my preparation method.

"What is the best culinary practice surrounding the water used to soak beans, pulses and rice?","Both my mother and grandmother, both now long passed away, would be horrified if when soaking beans, pulses, barley, lentils or rice etc. overnight for a soup or stew, the soaking liquid was used in the dish itself. My guess is that in their eyes, this action would reduce the amount of scum that floats to the surface during the cooking process, which to my knowledge, appears to be perfectly harmless protein which can be stirred back in.


Looking at similar questions, even the edge case of kidney or black beans, the liquid seems perfectly OK to use, provided it is cooked for the relevant period of time afterwards.


Is there ever a case when one should dispose of the soaking liquid rather than use it as additional flavouring to a stock (which is then cooked for a sufficient period)? Also, if that is not the case, should the pulses be stored in the refrigerator overnight as the liquid will have been stored well outside the safe temperature limits?

What is the best practice to making good fried rice without sticking to the pan?,"I just made fried rice earlier in a stainless steel frying pan to test the extent as to how much it will stick. I coated the pan with oil and initially placed garlic, then once the garlic was brown and aromatic, I added the rice. The rice sticked to the entire base of the pan and I already knew it was disaster then. Then adding an egg will compound this sticky mess and start to burn as they stick to the base of the pan and will taste like overcooked egg if left for long so I had to transfer the rice to a non-stick pan and just finish off.


I believe it is essential for the stainless steel pan to maintain some level of oil at all times else there will be nothing between the food and the pan which makes it stick. So what I think happened is that there was either not enough oil and/or the heat of the pan wasn't hot enough as well. It may be also possible that the rice absorbed the oil from the pan making the rest of the rice stick. But will that mean that each grain of rice should be coated will oil like in chinese/asian style fried rice? Typically each grain is shiny and the entire dish is very greasy. Another thing to consider is that the rice we used even if it was leftover from the refrigerator, it does feel a bit more starchy and less firm than those used in restaurant fried rice that I have eaten where there is a bite to it. The rice I used has great texture for eating as plain steamed rice, but probably not the best for fried rice. I do think it has a factor in why the rice sticked to the pan, but I am not sure.


Another factor is choosing the right pan. We almost always use non-stick pan (teflon I believe) since we often use minimal amounts of oil and don't prefer using lots of oil as it is not as healthy. Also, it was obviously easy and didn't end in disaster. When I think about it, I don't know of any other way I can make fried rice without a non-stick kind of pan. Traditionally chinese/asian restaurants will use a wok (I believe a carbon steel wok) that requires a seasoning to build over time to make in non-stick. But I would say, most households won't have this kind of pan to begin as well as the firepower to use them with so that means the pans of choice are often either non-stick (teflon/ceramic) pans, cast iron, or stainless steel. Cast iron is similar to carbon steel where a coating is needed to create that non-stick coating while teflon pans cannot use high temperature (which is often a must for good fried rice). I heard ceramic non-stick pans are not as non-stick compared to teflon but can withstand higher heat but I have never tried these. I doubt plenty of american households can maintain cast irons properly and the fact that it is was not built for stir frying due to its weight and shape, it is not ideal. Most likely the pans of choice of american households would then be either non-stick teflon wok/non-stick frying pans or stainless steel most of the time. So there is a huge dilemma and a trade off for every pan you use and there is a certain level of technique needed to be used to properly make proper fried rice.


What I want to know is what I did wrong why my fried rice became a total mess in my stainless steel pan. As well as the best way to create high quality fried rice at home that taste as good or close to the amazing chinese/asian restaurant fried rice.

How to properly brown cut-up chicken breast pieces?,"Yesterday I was trying to cook [""Chicken Tonight""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_Tonight). The jar instructs to cut 400 grams of chicken breast in ""small"" pieces (we use two jars, so I end up with 800 grams), then to brown those pieces in a pan.


No matter *what* I try, I can't get the chicken to brown: I've got the pan as hot as it can reasonably go. I'm using an induction stove, I put that on 'boost' and leave the pan for minutes, just heating up. As soon as I add fat (sometimes butter, sometimes olive oil) to the hot pan, it starts showing small bubbles/sizzling almost immediately, and I need to drop in the chicken or it will start to smell burnt.


But no matter what I do, the chicken won't brown. Instead, it starts losing a lot of what I think is water rather quickly, and then it will be more like it ends up cooking in that water. Here's [a picture](https://i.stack.imgur.com/0NgIE.png) of what I ended up with yesterday, there's a solid half cm of water on the bottom of the entire pan. This usually happens in a matter of seconds, and at that point I take the pan of the heat source. At this point, the chicken pieces are completely done, but except for maybe a slight brown edge on a few pieces, they're also all completely white. I just get rid of the fluid, add the sauce from the jars, and leave that to simmer at this point, because further attempts at getting the chicken to brown will end up with more fluid and drier meat, but no brown.

What type of skillet is most suitable for vegetable frying/sautéeing?,"I am a vegetarian and am wanting to buy a skillet. It's been a while since I last bought one and I am overwhelmed by the materials that exist. I am not sure which material would be most recommended for the following use case:


* The skillet will be mostly used for frying or sautéeing vegetables. No need to ever heat meat/fish.
* It will be exclusively used on a gas stove, and hand washed (does not need to be dishwasher-proof).
* Gas consumption is of my concern. Heating a huge chunk of metal only to shortly fry some vegetables seems like a huge waste. So whereas some websites recommend cast iron because it retains heat so well, I see this as a disadvantage, assuming it takes longer and more energy to actually get it hot.
* I would like the material to not stick too much, without using potentially hazardous non-stick materials such as Teflon/PFOA.
* I expect daily use. In an ideal world I could season/repair the pan if the non-stick properties somehow wear down (rather than having to throw it out after heavy use).


There are many materials listed on websites such as [this one](https://foodrevolution.org/blog/healthy-cookware/) or [this one](https://thegoodlifedesigns.com/healthy-non-toxic-cookware/) but I am not sure how the listed pros and cons compare when primarily using the pan for vegetables.

Can homemade vinegar be safely sealed in a bottle?,"When I've read kombucha recipes a last recommended step was to bottle the liquid, allow some gas buildup to carbonate it, and then refrigerate it to stop the bacteria from continuing to produce gas.

I'm now making vinegar instead of kombucha, and based on the few recipes I can find it seems to me that it is safe to seal the vinegar in a bottle but that's only because the recipes haven't told me specifically *not* to.


**Is homemade vinegar safe to store in a sealed bottle at room temperature?** With both kombucha and vinegar I start with a sweet mixture which I leave out for some time, and I understand that both should have some amount of both lactic and acetic acid producing bacteria to different degrees.

"When washing ingredients, does it matter if the water is cold or warm?","Inspired by [What is the point of washing produce in cold water?](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/117206/what-is-the-point-of-washing-produce-in-cold-water)


Multiple times I remember reading or getting advice that [ingredient X] needs to be washed in **cold** water before preparing and that warm water will... not precisely ruin them, but somehow make it worse.


Now, I don't remember precisely *which* ingredients those were... fish maybe? Or mushrooms? Could be some other vegetables too.


Anyways, this advice always has seemed suspicious to me. The difference in temperature between cold and warm water is maybe 30°C, not really enough to do anything chemically I think, and warm water is so much more pleasant for the hands... And especially for ingredients that you intend to cook right afterwards anyway, what harm can it do?


So - **are there any ingredients that actually *need* to be washed in cold water, otherwise it negatively affects the quality of the end result?** Preferably ones that are not super exotic.

An effective process to extract coconut oil,"I have tried to extract coconut oil. Below is the process I have followed.


1. Ground the coconut flesh with some added water.
2. Milked the ground coconut flesh by cold pressing it and filtering all big particles.
3. Dried the milk for a few hours in a steel vessel using butane flame.
4. Filtering out the dried brown residue.


The resulting oil looks like the following.


[![oil jar](https://i.stack.imgur.com/kwNib.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/kwNib.png)


My question is about the efficiency of my process. I have a strong feeling that the colouration is due to the heating or bad filtering techniques. I tried to rest it for the night, and it doesn't seem to have any ""heavier"" residues at the bottom of the oil bottle. I tried filtering it with 4-layer muslin cloth with no luck. Is there a process that does not involve heating (assuming my intuition is correct)?

How does deglazing work?,"If you put a steak or a chicken into a hot pan which is not completely non-stick, it is likely to stick to it a bit and leave a residue when you flip it. That is our fond.


Later we deglaze the pan by adding some liquid which causes all of the small bits to release (yes, adding onion or mushrooms counts as adding liquid, since it will release enough water), this incorporate deeper flavors into our cooking, which is absolutely great.


But how does deglazing work? On the chemical and physical level, is it somehow a different rate of contraction when rapidly cooled by the liquid, or some other kind of reaction?


And how come when I heat my stainless steel pan and put water on it, the burnt bits stuck to the side are not just magically floating away?

How do you significantly reduce the calories in bread like Franz Keto bread?,"Franz Bakery makes a bread that contains 35 calories a slice (the fact that it is keto is irrelevant to me, but may still be a part of the answer):
<https://franzbakery.com/HTML/productView#category=breads.premium&id=breads.premium.keto>


They also have hamburger and hotdog buns in the same line that have only 50 calories each.


Looking at their ingredients, forgetting mold inhibitors and unnecessary preservatives since the goal is to make this at home, it doesn't seem much different from classic bread ingredients:



> 
> BREAD BASE (MODIFIED WHEAT STARCH, WHEAT GLUTEN, INULIN OR CHICORY
> VEGETABLE FIBER, OAT FIBER, WHEAT PROTEIN ISOLATE), WATER, SOYBEAN
> OIL, CONTAINS 2% OR LESS OF EACH OF THE FOLLOWING: YEAST, SALT, SORBIC
> ACID (MOLD INHIBITOR), FULLY HYDROGENATED SOYBEAN OIL, DISTILLED
> VINEGAR, ASCORBIC ACID, CALCIUM PROPIONATE (MOLD INHIBITOR), ENZYMES.
>

I can tell there is a ton of fiber, since they're attempting to make keto friendly bread with 1g net carbs (12g carbs - 11g Dietary Fiber), but I'm wondering what they're doing that is making the bread so calorie friendly.


In most recipes for basic bread, a slice is usually between 100 to 200 calories per slice. I cannot (after plenty of Google search refinements) find a recipe that manages to come close.


How are they reducing the calories by at least half, and how can I do this at home instead of paying $6.50 a loaf/pack?

Is it possible to cook an egg in a thermos flask?,"Scenario: I want to hard-boil a single whole egg with the least amount of effort and active cooking time. I don't own an egg steamer and don't want to buy another kitchen gadget that takes up space without being used most of the time. I also don't want to cook the egg in a pot of boiling water because it seems wasteful to heat up so much water for a single egg. *(Edit: I only have 2 sizes of stove hobs, so the smallest pot I own is the size of the smallest hob: 14,5 cm / 5.7 inch diameter)*


However, I do have a thermos flask with 1 liter capacity and an opening big enough to put an egg inside. Yesterday I put an egg in and filled it with about half a liter of freshly boiling water. After 25 minutes only a few millimeters of the outer eggwhite were cooked and the inside was completely liquid. I took the egg directly from the fridge, so that might have contributed to the fail.


I also thought about putting the egg directly into my electric kettle, but if the shell cracks it would be a nightmare to clean the kettle afterwards.


I know that microwaving an egg has an insanely high risk of the thing exploding in your face. There are many reports of people receiving really bad burns to their faces and hands.


**Is it even possible to cook an egg in a thermos flask? Is there maybe another method I overlooked?** I'm willing to wait about an hour for the egg to finish cooking, as long as I don't have to actively monitor the process.

Update:


I tried again with the 2 methods that appealed to me the most:


[Joe M's method: egg in thermos flask](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/117311/71396). I only have the ""keep things warmer for a little longer"" kind of flask, not the ""keep things hot for hours"" vacuum kind, but if I fill it up to the brim with boiling water and gently tilt it every 5 minutes to even out the temperature insite, I can get a hard-boiled egg in 20 minutes.


[Tjaden Hess' method: steaming in a pot](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/117305/71396). This works like magic. I made a little ""throne"" for the egg from aluminium foil and boiled a cup of water in the electric kettle before pouring it into the pot, which was heating up in the meantime. After pouring the water and adding the lid, I could turn the hob down to the lowest setting and forget about the egg for 10 minutes. It came out perfect and this method required the least effort and resources by far.

How long should one steam food to reheat safely?,"One of the big problems with reheating food in a microwave or an oven is that it dries out the dish. To safely eat reheated food, it requires to be brought up to 165F or 75C.


How long on average, would a dish take to come up to this temperature when steamed in a domestic steamer? I'm thinking of something like mixed fried rice or meat biryani etc.,something where the steam can penetrate easily. I'd also be interested to hear if this would be a suitable method of heating frozen food, e.g. lasagne.


My theory is that this method would keep the contents moist, but at the same time not dry the dish out excessively.


I'd be particularly interested to hear of those with exposure to commercial steam ovens, as I believe these are frequently used for reheating food in hospitals etc.

Why did my fruit tart cream/custard have spots in it?,"I just made a fruit tart for the first time in my life. I searched for fruit tart recipes and I decided to use a [5-star recipe](https://preppykitchen.com/fruit-tart/) with the most ratings to try to minimize the possibility that anything would go wrong.


The recipe says the following for the cream/custard filling:



> 
> Ingredients: 2 cups whole milk, 1/2 vanilla bean, 6 egg yolks, 2/3 cup sugar, 1/4 cup cornstarch, 1 tbsp cold unsalted butter
> 
> 
> 1. In a medium saucepan, heat the milk and vanilla bean to a boil over medium heat. Immediately turn off the heat and set aside to infuse for 15 minutes.
> 2. In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until light and fluffy.
> 3. Add the cornstarch and whisk vigorously until no lumps remain. Whisk in 1/4 cup of the hot milk mixture until incorporated.
> 4. Whisk in the remaining hot milk mixture, reserving the saucepan. Pour the mixture through a strainer back into the saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until thickened and slowly boiling. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter.
> 
> 
> 


The only thing I did differently from the recipe was to not include the 1/2 vanilla bean in Step 1. Instead, while stirring in the butter in Step 4, I also added 1/2 tbsp of vanilla extract. Besides that, I followed exactly what the recipe said to do.


So what happened is that during Step 3, while I was whisking the 1/4 cup of hot milk into the mixture, I started seeing some spots in the mixture. By the end of Step 4, there were a lot of spots in the mixture, as you can see:


[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/TQOhA.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/TQOhA.png)


Also, during Step 4, the cream/custard turned very thick very quickly, and I couldn't pour it out of the saucepan like the recipe mentioned. Instead I had to spoon it out into a bowl. So I guess I messed up the consistency, although the final result wasn't bad and seemed to taste fine.


So what caused all of those spots to appear in the cream/custard?

Material used for Portuguese custard tart molds,"From a [previous question](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/117230/temperature-of-a-muffin-pan-right-under-a-gas-oven-broiler), it was recommended that for Portuguese custard tarts to use [galvanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanization) steel or aluminum molds, and also that the oven be heated to minimally 250°C (482°F). [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPoMY7dA06I) at ~2:49 has the oven temperature at ~380°C (716°F) so putting the oven to as high as possible does seem right.


However, in a comment right underneath, it noted that at these temperatures the zinc coating may strip, and while [this website](https://galvanizeit.org/hot-dip-galvanizing/how-long-does-hdg-last/in-extreme-temperatures) seems to concur in that the highest recommended temperature is 200°C (392°F) for long term exposure, it stated that 350°C (662°F) is fine for short term (<2 hours) exposure, which is definitely within the expected range of baking the tart, and also far from the temperatures that usual ovens can produce.


However, I'm also wondering about the differences between using different other mold materials like stainless steel, cast iron, carbon steel, tin foil, silicone, etc. in mainly how long they should be baked, but also whether there's any difference in baking methods (i.e., bake for x minutes, then blast underneath the broiler for y minutes).

* ~3.6 cm bottom diameter
* 2.7 cm - 3 cm height


which is a slightly smaller bottom and considerably taller height. My question is how (or whether) these differences in sizes affect the tart, and whether the ones from Amazon or the latter site would give a result that'd be considered closer to a ""proper"" pastel de nata.

I have some theories, but I would love to hear your thoughts on this:


* Maybe by the time the centre is cooked the outer part is already overcooked.

[![Two-Hour Candy from Out of Henderson Kitchens](https://i.stack.imgur.com/FFo4x.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/FFo4x.jpg)


While I’m not experienced with using evaporated milk, my general experience is that if I attempt to boil a mix like that for an hour and a half, it will go far beyond 235° Fahrenheit.


This is probably about six times the amount of candy I would normally make, but while I would expect it to take longer to *come* to a boil, I would not expect it to take such a long time *after* it comes to a boil.


Am I wrong? Or am I misreading this recipe in some way?


“Two-Hour Candy” appears to be a unique title, and I was surprised at how few responses “Pet Milk Candy” returns. I did find an interesting Pet Milk cookbook from 1930, [Pet Recipes](https://lib.msu.edu/sliker/object/2441/), (it’s part of MSU’s fascinating [Little Cookbooks](https://lib.msu.edu/sliker/) collection) but found no corresponding recipe in it.


I realize that I could just boil it to the appropriate temperature and disregard the time, but that assumes I’m reading the recipe correctly and not misunderstanding terms that may have changed over half a century or so.

how long is vacuum sealed meat safe at room temperature before spoiling,"I've seen several great posts about food safety, such as:


* <https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/34671>
* <https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/17550>


This includes the ""safe limit for raw or cooked food is 2 hours"". But what if that food has been vacuum sealed? Will it last longer before it must be disposed of? All I've found is that vacuum sealed food should not be left at room temperature indefinitely, but no comment on its safe limit. Perhaps it's also 2 hours, but I would like to confirm that explicitly.


I have steam-cooked dog food (chicken) that is sold refrigerated. Once opened, I store the food in vacuum sealed containers (zwilling), which i typically refrigerate between servings. On two occasions I have vacuumed the container, and then forgot to put it in the fridge. I find it ~4 hours later on the counter. I've thrown it out, but the act bugs me, particularly being unsure if it is still safe as it has been vacuumed.

What is the best practice storage method for flour to avoid bugs?,"I have recently decided that I'd rather have base ingredients that I am store in my pantry in order to make more meals from scratch as opposed to getting things premade. A friend of mine told me there's no way that they would store flour anywhere but the fridge, otherwise it would eventually get bugs in it.


I have looked around and found these two related questions:


[Is it okay to keep flour in the freezer?](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/33890/is-it-okay-to-keep-flour-in-the-freezer/33892#33892)

However I don't think that either really addresses specifically the concern of bugs, or the preferred storage location of pantry vs. fridge vs. freezer.
I don't do much baking, but I wouldn't be opposed to starting (provided that my flour doesn't get bugs in it!) For now though, most of my uses of flour would be in small amounts for stovetop recipes and the occasional breading, so I'm not too concerned about my flour not rising properly ([mentioned here](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/33891/94623)), or throwing off the baking time because of a temperature difference ([mentioned here](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/44341/94623)). Is the fridge enough to stop the bugs? Or is a freezer necessary? Is the container being airtight the only thing that matters?

I want to get an induction cooktop, but the ones I can afford only have 10 temperature settings.


I worry that the gradations won't give me enough precision at low temperatures. Like, maybe at a 1 it'll heat the contents to 70°C, and at a 2 it'll heat them to 80°C - so I wouldn't be able to cook at 75°C if I wanted.

What is the best way to reduce the genesis of oil vapors and aerosols when frying?,"I would like to clarify I am ***not*** asking about **oil splatter** nor am I asking about **air filtration** tools.


What is the best way to reduce **the generation of** frying aerosols and vapors that can condense on distant surfaces such as those in rooms adjacent to a kitchen without changing cooking temperature or method of cooking, in this case, pan frying?


Is the smoke point of the cooking lubricant the greatest factor for aerosols and vapors or is there something else that impacts it more strongly such as the amount of moisture in the food being cooked which increases the amount of sizzling and splatter which may generate fine aerosols that remain airborne?


Can an oil vaporize without ever reaching its smoke point or is the term ""smoke point"" synonymous with evaporation? Maybe my question is misguided and oils cannot actually vaporize, but rather only become a fine mist, or maybe the smoke itself is what is sticking to the surfaces as what appears to be an oily film.


Is there an index for different types of cooking lubricants regarding their evaporation points rather than smoke points if they do indeed evaporate?

"Is this layer on top of my fermented peppers mold? If it is not, is it still safe to eat?","I'm fermenting my home grown scotch bonnets, and I'm concerned that they're molding and are no longer edible.


My setup was an open container, with a relatively high salt to water concentration (I don't remember specifics. I googled proper fermentation salt contents, and used a high value, maybe 10%). I used another cleaned jar to weigh down the peppers in the solution, so there was very little air contact.


Unfortunately I had to change the container they were in, because I moved to a new apartment and couldn't transport them in the original fermentation container.


I washed the container before using it, and added more salt to the solution, since they were already fermented and I was only concerned about them spoiling.


Not long after changing containers, the ferment got brown clouds of something, but since they smelled good, I didn't worry too much.


Now, however, there is a translucent film on top of my solution, which is bad enough, and also puffs of mold around the top of the container.


Here's my theory on what this is: the layer on top of my solution is yeast, and some bits of pepper stuck to the lid are molding. However, I'm looking for some more opinions before risking eating these.


What I was planning to do was blend these into hot sauce. Is this still safe to do, since it would end up in my fridge for several weeks? Or should I use them up ASAP? Or is it dangerous and I should pitch all of it?

Must cast iron be cleaned promptly?,"There is yet one more detail I seem to have just understood about cooking in cast iron pans.


After use (frying onions, frying potatoes, ..) the pan must be cleaned quite soon, perhaps within 24 hours of use.


This is the case despite using relatively little (grapeseed) oil: not so much to make the result greasy, but also not so little that food gets scorched and burns from direct contact with the bare pan.


If cleaning is not done promptly—if, for example, the pan is left with a thin (1 mm) layer of oil—the oil will tend to build a gummy, non-uniform, and non-polymerized layer that is hard to clean. Anything one uses to clean (even a stainless-steel chain cleaning tool) will become gummied.


Can you comment on this detail? Is this actually true? After a get-together when the kitchen looks frighteningly hard to clean, can one ever leave a cast iron pan for cleaning seven or so days later? Might it perhaps be sufficient to remove the excess oil before leaving for seven days? I can continue experimenting of course, but I'd rather hear expert opinion to reduce the number of these experiments.


**Detail**


If you do have a gummied cast iron pan, the only real solution is to leave it in the oven for one hour at 450-500F. (Lodge's website says so, and so it must be true.) I expected that the extra gummy oil will liquify and drip. Not so. It merely burns. I could then scrape the pan (until going back down to nearly the bare metal, wasting one year of seasoning), thinly oil, and bake again upside down briefly.

Marinade tenderizing process,"This [article](https://www.thespruceeats.com/science-of-marinades-1809224) is trying to explain some of the science behind marination, but I don't really understand what they are trying to say here.



> 
> As far back as pre-Columbian Mexico, cooks found that wrapping meats in papaya leaves before cooking made for more tender results. The active enzyme in the papaya leaves is papain, now refined from papayas and commercially available. The connective tissue that comes in direct contact with the protein-digesting enzymes gets broken down. These tenderizing enzymes also reduce the capability of the meat to hold its juices, resulting in greater fluid loss and thus drier meat. Enzymes are heat activated at levels between 140 F and 175 F and deactivated at the boiling point, so it serves no purpose other than flavoring to let the meat sit in a marinade at room temperature. Refrigeration is recommended to avoid the growth of harmful bacteria. Let meat come to room temperature before cooking.

So do these enzymes have a positive or negative effect? What's with that last part where they are activated at higher temperatures, but then says to refrigerate it?

I know this may sound like a simple answer: just add more salt, but I'm afraid of doing so because I know salt negatively affects yeast development.


Can I just add more salt until I like it and it won't affect the dough rising so much, or maybe should I remove some sugar? The recipe I follow calls for 35g sugar (again considering 340g flour) plus 60g milk which is already slightly sweet.

Can I pre-smoke a brisket safely?,"For Thanksgiving, I was planning on slow-cooking a brisket in a smoker. However, I have learned somewhat last minute that instead of my family coming to my place for dinner, I will be going to their place. The issue is that we live roughly 6-7 hours apart by car.


So my question is this: can I do a partial cook in the smoker, then chill the brisket back down and put it in a cooler for transport, then finish the cooking there in a Crock Pot? Most places I've looked at on Google talks about cold-smoking the brisket, but I don't have time to go through that whole process (I leave early Wednesday morning and smoking there isn't an option).


My concerns:


* Partially cooking the meat then cooling it back down will cause it to go dry and/or chewy.
* I'd rather not fully refreeze the meat during transport (and I doubt I have time to anyway), but bringing it to fridge temps might result in it sweating during refrigeration and/or transport, damaging the crust and reducing or eliminating the flavor of the smoke.
* Bringing the meat back and forth through the danger zone a minimum of three times may result in the meat being unsafe to eat.


Is there a way to do this in a way that is safe and retains the flavor (within reason), or should I just forget about it and settle for liquid smoke or something?

Why won't my whipped cream (with extras) stiffen up?,"I wanted to spice up my whip cream so I used this recipe:


* 1 c. heavy cream, chilled
* 1/2 c. Packed light brown sugar

* 2 t. bourbon


I chilled the mixing bowl, mixed the ingredients - let them chill for 3 hours - then used my mixer to 'whip' up the cream topping, and all I got was a consistency that was slightly stiffer than the sour cream.


Am I doing something wrong? Or is that the consistency I can expect from a sour cream whip?

What are the names and purposes of these six kitchen knives?,"My longtime neighbor had this collection of six GONON-GIRONDE high-carbon steel knives that she inherited from her mother. I thought that they were incredible, and must be wonderful to use.


Sadly she passed away, and her husband, who does not cook, knowing that I coveted the knives, gave them to me. They are a joy to use, and I think of her every time I get one of them out. The patina on them was there when I received them, and knowing that they are high-carbon steel, and stain easily, I clean and dry them immediately after each use. I also bought a nice whet stone set which permits me to put an exceptional edge on the blades.


I've assigned a number to each knife in the attached photo, and I would like to know the formal name and purpose of each knife. I am assuming that numbers 3-5 are chef knives, and that's how I use them. And I recognize number 2 as being the style of knife often used to carve smoked brisket here in east Texas (and it performs that task perfectly), but I am pretty confident that there's more to it than my simple observations. In additional, I am keen to know the name and purpose of numbers 1 and 6. (By the way, number 6 has a sharp edge, so I doubt that it is a bread knife.)


Any information that can be offered will be gratefully appreciated.

How can I prevent reductions from turning into molasses?,"Last night I attempted to make a reduced sauce out of equal parts soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar. I let it simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat until it got to a mildly viscous consistency where dragging my spatula briefly left a trail in the pan, then put it in a jar and put it in the fridge. The next day it was practically solid - I heated it up for 30 seconds in the microwave and it had the consistency of molasses. This was despite it being still pretty runny when I took it off the heat.


I've noticed this has happened a couple of times, and I want to know if there's something I'm doing wrong. Perhaps I should be taking it off the heat much earlier (though at that point there would be no trail left in the pan by my spatula, contradicting what most people suggest).


I also noticed at one point the mixture was bubbling quite a bit - I think I let it get too hot, which promoted crystallization of the sugar. Is it possible overheating the sugar results in too thick a reduction, and one should vigilantly watch their saucepan to prevent it from overheating?

Can I (or should I) re-roughen the interior of a ceramic mortar?,"I have a ceramic mortar & pestle, approximately 10 cm across, that I use primarily for grinding whole spices. When I bought it about 15 years ago, only the exterior of the mortar (and a small amount of the interior) was glazed; the interior had an unfinished, rough texture akin to bisqueware. Similarly, the bottom 2–3 cm of the pestle was also rougher in texture.


After many years of usage, this rougher texture has been smoothed out in the center of the mortar and at the end of the pestle. I think (though it may just be confirmation bias) that this makes it less effective at grinding, as the spices are not ""gripped"" as much by the ceramic surfaces.

I made it and next day it wasn't done. I left it for 2 more days and still not done. I took it out of the fridge. And 2 days later and still not done!!

### Update : results


I tried using this patch as is.  

But it was sharp and had a bitter aftertaste.  

So I decided to ""fix"" it following your recommendations.


Here is what I suspect went wrong. First thing as you guys mentioned below, my onion was pretty thick. Also, I realized that my vinegar was very stale and I still went with (1:1) ratio with water. Also, I didn't pour the brine immediately after boiling. And I just left it outside until it just cooled down to room temp.


So here is how I tried to reverse that.  

I separated the onions from the brine to change a few things :


1. I cut the onions more thin
2. I increased the vinegar concentration (by adding extra amount then boiling it)
3. I added more salt
4. I poured the boiling brine immediately on the onions
5. I left it outside the fridge for more than 3 hours


I left them for overnight because it's extremely cold here.


The results :  

**Color was way off than presented** (`very pale greyish purple`).  

The onion slice has a uniform color now.  

Isn't vibrant whatsoever. but better than before.  

**Texture was amazing**. (`Crunchy as desired`).  

**Taste was pretty good**. (`very tasty and vinegary`).  

I don't know if that what it supposed to taste like. But I like it so much.


If I made a new patch (I know I will) I will post if the results are different. Thanks for your time and help.

Boeuf a la ficelle - cooked in bouillon?,"I'm looking to make boeuf a la ficelle as part of Christmas dinner this year, but am struggling to find a consensus on the execution.


In the Les Halles Cookbook the recipe says to add the beef to water (alongside vegetables and bouquet garni). Other recipes online appear to add a bouillon cube to the water, or make up bouillon and add the vegetables and beef directly.


Is there any consensus on the right/best method? Anthony Bourdain says on pretty much every other recipe in the book to use a good homemade stock, so if it is bouillon the beef and vegetables need to go into it seems a pretty glaring omission...


I also have some guests that prefer well done beef to rare - recipes online say that the cooking liquid can be ladled over rarer slices to cook through - how effective is this?

Does peppers (capsaicin) actually burn?,"I know that capsaicin just triggers a receptor `TRPV1` that senses heat. Therefore makes you feel pain.


But, my question is, is it just a fake sensation or there is real heat involved?


**Scenario 1**  

Eating spicy food in winter makes you feel warm.
Does that mean your temp is still the same but you just (mentally) feeling warmer?


**Scenario 2**  

If you got peppers oils on your hands while cutting them and preparing food, your hands feel burning all day. Is it only an illusion? If we took thermal camera, would that spot look more ""red"" in the camera? Or it would be the same as the body?


**Scenario 3**  

When you eat spicy food, you actually turn red. It's visible to the eyes. If we took your body temperature with an infrared thermometer, will it give higher reading than before eating? Or just normal?


Maybe it DOES heat but that's the body reaction to it? Like somehow the body is trying to get rid of excess heat through skin or something? I didn't fully think this part but that depends on if there is actually heat involved or not.

Edit (kinda answers my question)
--------------------------------


So, I found [this video](https://youtu.be/yHkpPaceryc)

and the person did get more red.  

they said :

So, the pepper itself doesn't heat you directly.  

But it raises heart rate.  

Thus, increasing your temperature.


However, I also found [that video](https://youtu.be/KsXc7yWcQ_Y).  

It's in Russian, so, I don't understand what they are saying.  

But, he put a pepper on his skin and chewed on one. The temperature of the spot didn't go up.

Getting well domed muffins,"Seems to be conflicting info on achieving well domed muffin tops. None seem to offer science based references.


These two are good examples of conflicting advice.
Higher temp seems to be all that is agreed.


<https://www.bakingkneads.com/how-to-make-muffins-rise-higher/>


1 – Get the Temperature Right
400f


2 – Use Room-Temperature Ingredients


3 – Don’t Wait Too Long to Put the Muffins in the Oven


4 – Try to Make Thick Batter


5 – Fill the Muffin Tins Properly
3/4 full


<https://www.thekitchenwhisperer.net/2012/07/22/bakery-style-high-domed-muffins-how-do-they-do-that/>


1. Let the batter rest at least an hour or overnight in the fridge (preferred)


Do you know why you should let your muffin batter rest?  During the resting period, starch molecules in the flour are absorbing the liquid in the batter.


This causes them to swell and gives the batter a thicker, more viscous consistency. Any gluten formed during the mixing of the batter is also getting time to relax, and air bubbles are slowly working their way out.


Instructions


1. Always use a From-Scratch muffin recipe, never boxed!
2. Never use a mixer to incorporate your dry ingredients to your wet. Use a spatula or spoon.
3. Do not over mix your batter.
4. Cover your batter tightly and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (can go overnight as well).
5. Preheat your oven to 425F. Yes, I know the recipe calls for 350 but trust me on this. I typically bake my muffins in the upper third of the oven. You see placing the muffins in the upper third of the oven it tends to be hotter and the heat more constant. You can most certainly use the middle rack as well if you want.
6. Spray the top of your muffin pan with non-stick spray. Line the pan with cupcake/muffin liners.
7. The batter will be THICK. You can gently stir it first. Just try not to deflate it. Fill the muffin papers almost ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP OF THE PAPER. (just leave about a 1/8″ from the top).


Yes I know, it’s spilled over before but this works.If you have empty cavities in your muffin tin (not enough batter), remove the liner and add 1/2 cup water in each.


8. Bake 6-9 minutes at 425. The muffins should be about a 1/4″-1/2″ above the paper. That’s the sign the heat can be turned down.
9. Reduce heat to 350 (DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR TO DROP THE TEMP.. sorry for the YELLING.. lol) and bake for 6-10 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out barely clean (crumbs are OK).


What does the science (and experience) tell us?

What are the best practices when making chapathi like a pancake or dosa?,"Normally, chapathi/roti is made by kneading wheat flour, letting it rest a while, then making balls of them and rolling them into flat circular shapes and then heating them.  

[This answer](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/28815/7812) describes how letting it rest, allows gluten linking and the transformation of starches into sugar.


After many years of making chapathi, I felt this process of kneading and rolling is time-consuming and cumbersome. Besides, the middle layer and some edges often do not get cooked fully and many people end up overheating it, so it gets burnt spots. Since the process of making dosa's and pancakes are simpler, I wondered if flour can be used similarly. Turns out there are indeed recipes for doing this.


If I may call this a way of making chapathi like dosa (chaposa), it involves taking equal proportions of water and flour, mixing it while ensuring there are no lumps, and simply spreading them on a heated pan, and preparing it like how a pancake or dosa would be prepared. I prepared one today, and it turned out ok. It was soft enough and seemed properly cooked. I figured that this may be a good way to make aaloo parathas too, by throwing in mashed potatoes, onions, coriander leaves and other ingredients. Kinda wish even puri-making could be made this simple.


In terms of the gluten linking and starch converting to sugars, are there any best practices that need to be followed for preparing it? Time allowed for resting etc?

Why is wheat flour more popular than corn flour?,"If I understand correctly, one of the major reasons that corn syrup is so popular is that it made corn syrup cheaper than sugar. This makes sense to me.


However, it seems odd to me that this never really happened with corn flour/cornmeal vs wheat flour. While they definitely taste different, they still can often fill similar roles, and assuming that corn flour was cheaper, I'd expect it to gradually take over recipes in the US.

Pulled pork slightly too tart and watery,"I made some pulled pork over the holidays in an Instantpot which came out fairly well.


* 3 pounds boneless pork butt roast. 40 minute cook time.
* bbq sauce based on ketchup and cider vinegar
* more cider vinegar in the liquid


It came out pretty good for a first try, no complaints. Shredded fine, tasted good. Still, it felt a bit too tart and thin.


I think I can fix the tartness by cutting down on the cider proportions a bit, maybe add some more sugar too.


But how do I get a creamier, more unctuous mouthfeel? If it was a curry dish, I'd probably think I was skimping on the coconut milk, as usual. If it was a mac and cheese, maybe my roux would need to be thicker, with more butter and flour. But there are no such ingredients involved in this recipe.


There's a related question, [Fix for Greasy Pulled Pork?](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/90734/64096) that is making me think that maybe one possibility is to cook it a bit longer than 40 minutes. Or should I uncover it and continue on heat for a while to reduce the liquid?

How much potato to add to reduce saltiness,"I've heard that adding potato to an overly salty dish can reduce the saltiness.


I prepared 500g of rabbit meat in a pressure cooker. Realized that I had added one teaspoon worth of salt more than what was necessary. Since the meat seemed to need a bit more cooking anyway, I peeled and sliced a medium sized potato and dunked it into the pressure cooker which still had the rabbit curry in it, and re-cooked it on medium flame until steam formation. I assume this is the right way to add potato. Not sure if the potato can be boiled separately and then added to a curry to reduce saltiness.


Two hours later I opened it and I'm not quite sure if the saltiness reduced...though it seemed like it did a bit.


So in this kind of a situation, for the proportions I mentioned, how much potato (in grams or size) would be required to reduce excess saltiness? Perhaps the saltiness could be quantified as excess by the number of teaspoons added beyond ""just right"".


I know different people like different proportions of salt. Please dont focus on the salt. The question is about how much of potato to add to 500g of any dish to have a noticeable reduction in saltiness.

The recipe for baking it requires you to add 1 large or 1.5 diced apples to the cake mix. I was thinking about replacing this with a roughly similar amount of frozen mango chunks instead, since I have then readily on-hand.

What would be the best way to freeze and reheat home-made pizza,"I have been baking home-made pizza (home-made dough, toppings etc.). with great results, using a pizza steel and a ripping hot regular domestic oven. The base is crispy with leopard spots, and the crust puffy and chewey. The end result is far better than any of the pre-packaged supermarket varieties.


I'd now like to freeze individual pizzas so they could be reheated from frozen in a regular oven without a pizza steel for friends and family etc. What would be the best way to do this to get a pizza close to the original? I'm guessing the best approach would be to part-bake the base, leave it to cool, then add the cold toppings and freeze. My pizzas only need 4 minutes to fully bake, maybe 5 if I am baking a lot as the oven temperature falls.


I'm thinking of part-baking the base for 2 minutes. Would I need to do anything else for best results, including pricking the base or using pie weights to stop the dough rising? Is it worth adding a thin layer of olive oil to stop the dough drying out in the middle of the pie? Are there any toppings that would not freeze/reheat well? As to reheat times, I'm assuming 20 minutes in a 220C fan oven will be adequate, but advice much appreciated.


The dough recipe I use is a regular twice-proved one (4 hours max), with bread flour, water, salt, sugar, yeast and olive oil. I don't use a poolish or long fermentation times, and knead this for 10 minutes in a stand mixer.

Can we ferment cellulose (outside of our body) to turn it into food?,"I recently read about (wild) fermentation of vegetables. I learned that:


* By adding salt and water and keeping out the oxygen, we create a biome that favours cetain types of bacteria/yeast.
* The bacteria/yeast metabolize certain molecules of the vegetables, grow/multiply and excrete fragments of those molecules.
* This leaves both the excrements and the bacteria/yeast for us to eat, which are partly more easily digestible for us than the non-fermented vegetable (e.g. we can't digest inulin well, fructose works better), and partly we get molecules this way that were not even inside the vegetable in the first place - the bacteria/yeast produced them.


Then I read about ruminants:


* They have certain types of bacteria in their stomach/gut.
* The bacteria turn cellulose into smaller molecules and grow/multipy.
* The ruminants then digest both the smaller molecules and the excess bacteria.


It is exactly the same. Since cellulose is everywhere, and if it were food, nobody would need to starve - the question comes quite naturally:


**What ruminants do with cellulose in their digestive systems, can we do the same in a jar?**


* I assume people have tried that before and didn't succeed, since otherwise it would be part of food processing culture at least somewhere in the world. But I haven't heard of it. Why is it so difficult?
* Don't take the question ""in a jar"" literally. Nowadays we have so much technology at hand that we can probably emulate the digestive system of an animal, with different chambers containing different types of bacteria, having different temperatures etc.. Has anyone ever done this successfully? And if yes, was the total energy yield positive?

Could a pizza gas oven with only an under-the-stone burner work well?,"I've been looking at options of for-home pizza gas ovens. The Ooni Koda stuff cost about twice than I'd like to spend, and even then I saw some YouTube review which showed it doesn't really get to stated temperatures after an entire hour.


So there's a cheap-ish used option of some rebranded Chinese-made oven, for whom I can't find any reviews. On the importer's website they claim it can reach 400-450 Celsius, that it is made of stainless steel, has 1 burner, a closable glass door and an adjustable chimney to contain or release heat. Stone size is about 13"", and it should supposedly be able to cook the pizza in 90 seconds with a BTU of 13,000.


The seller said it has a burner only under the stone and said that after preheating it for 10-15 minutes it took between 120-150 seconds to cook the pizza. They only used it once ""because their landlord decided he doesn't allow anything gas-operated in his apartment"".


So you can see why I'm not sure if this oven form is problematic. Perhaps the upper heat would be *too* low, burning the underside of the pizza before the upperside is ready.

Answers to a recent question [accidentally ate raw corn starch](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/119790/20413) say that corn starch, like wheat flour, is meant to be cooked before eating, but icing sugar isn't usually heated.

Is it safe to reheat mushrooms?,"According to this very popular Bright Side video (<https://youtu.be/P2BVyHOdFUo>) , it is not safe to reheat mushrooms as they not only lose their nutritional value, but can also make you ill. This, clearly, is a very simplistic position as we would not have such delicacies as tinned mushroom soup, and pre-cooked mushrooms on pizza toppings etc.


So what precautions should one take when reheating mushrooms? Is it a particular variety that is prone to this? I have been cooking and reheating fresh white and brown mushrooms in dishes for many years now in stews and casseroles without any ill effects. Have I just been lucky?

Georgian dessert based on walnuts,"When I was a kid, some 40 years ago, I visited the country of Georgia and had a dessert I still (vaguely) remember but could never find a note on.


It was based on a **whole unripe walnut** (I think it was a walnut - it could have been a large nut) that was in some kind of syrup (or at last fluid). I do not remember the taste but the texture was crunchy.


Does that ring a bell?


I searched for Georgian desserts and the only ones notable I could find related to walnuts are [Churchkhela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchkhela) and [Gozinaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gozinaki) but both are made of ripe walnuts (the semi round, brain-like inside) and not unripe whole ones.

Efficient method to peel onions?,"How do you efficiently peel an onion, so both time and material wasted is minimized?


The way I do it: I cut off the stem part farthest from the roots (which has to go anyways, and gives me a nice flat bit to stand the onion on for the next cut), then slice it in half. [At this point](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/5494756ae4b0edcae6dddb54/1561064247438-843M9G067N343ZSPQLE4/815kv1Ns16L._SL1500_.jpg?format=1500w&content-type=image%2Fjpeg) comes the crux: to peel off the brown outermost layer, I can worry at it with my fingernails or a knife, but that brown stuff mostly flakes/brakes off and doesn't detach in a nice way, except in very rare occasions. Even though it's material efficient, it takes too long.


Alternatively, I can peel off the next-to-outermost good (""meaty"") layer together with the brown skin, which goes very fast but wastes that layer.

Can I use regular gas (stove) cookware (pots and pans) in a fireplace?,"I went somewhere with a fireplace. Let's say the place and cookware are mine. The kitchen works with fire (gas stove), so the cookware works for gas (I've used it before for a long time).


**According to my research, a [gas stove](https://thewholeportion.com/how-hot-is-the-gas-stove-flame/) can go up to +-1650C and a [fireplace](https://fireplacetown.com/how-hot-does-a-fireplace-get#:%7E:text=In%20general%2C%20most%20fireplaces%20reach,type%20of%20fuel%20being%20used.) +-550C**


I know that to cook in fire usually it's required to do it in the embers. E.G: some bricks to make a support, add a BBQ grill, and there you go (*Done it. Messy because of oils dripping there, but works*). **But what about regular cookware which will be in touch with the embers** (SUPPOSING that with regular cookware you do it that way) Imagine heating up a pot with popcorn kernels (it'd be [hot enough](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/59648/how-hot-does-popcorn-need-to-be-before-it-pops)), making some hot chocolate, etc.


**My guess is that** apart from getting the pots dirty and probably harming the handles if they are made out of anything different than the material the pot is made (usually hard plastic or w/e), **it should work fine**. Although in this site I usually ask and also experiment to try out and post the results , I really don't want to risk it this time. Temperatures are higher in a gas stove (although not constant, not everywhere in touch), so these variables make me doubt.

Dutch oven vs. water pan for bread baking,"I see a lot of successful home bread bakers using dutch ovens in their home ovens. They preheat the dutch oven, bake the proofed loaf inside the oven, and eventually remove the cover of the dutch oven to promote browning.


I also own a few books on bread baking and this method isn't seemingly popular amongst the pros. I'm quite fond of ""The Bread Baker's Apprentice"" by Peter Reinhart and he suggests sliding the loaf on a baking stone/steel and to put a cast iron pan on the floor of the oven with water in it. Both methods presumably lead to moisture being present around the loaf.


What are the pros and cons of each method? Would they lead to almost identical outcomes, or are there some key differences?

Compensate for low-performance gas stovetop,"**Disclosure**: this question and topic relates strictly to kitchen gadgetry rather
than anything else.


My range is horribly lacking in multiple ways, and it has (despite my best efforts to accommodate for it) compromised countless baked/cooked resources.


Specifically, the entire stovetop component retains burners that supply a low-output [BTU](https://www.bluestarcooking.com/news/all/much-cooking-power-really-need/) (the value of which I'm unsure of and wouldn't really trust if I could find it anyway), and this situation results in many dishes being destroyed or made too complicated, which in turn manifests in all other async operations being made avoidably difficult. For example, I have an All-Clad 8QT stockpot that takes ~20 minutes for 6QT of pure water to come to a boil, and that's unacceptably long. Moreover, it's made worse during thermal recovery when I plunge meats or pastas/dumplings into said pot (forget how awfully this gets when I'm working in batches, it's like scuttling your own ship), and the boil takes (at a minimum) 1-2 minutes to regain the boiling state, at which point (*especially* for pastas), the resource is totally ruined.


Without purchasing an entirely new range (or stovetop), what are some smaller, portable options I can use that will resolve my issue described here?


I've researched induction and other gas options like [this](https://www.toolots.com/gh-2.html?cid=9107278969&gclid=CjwKCAiAyPyQBhB6EiwAFUuaknXbtszZSPObnwnS0wjZFb3iuQawioEzrkHN_no1IMjjlDIWDVisDBoC8mwQAvD_BwE) but want some SME insight on a recommended path forward here.

Why does spinach come in an airtight bag?,"When I buy spinach from the supermarket, it comes in a sealed plastic bag. There is always quite a lot of moisture inside the bag on the leaves. I used to find that spinach would last about 3 days in the fridge inside this bag, and then go mushy and bad.


I realised recently that the moisture is the problem. If I open the bag and spread the spinach out to dry for a couple of hours before putting it in the fridge, I find it lasts for up to 2 weeks. Given that the spinach lasts so much better this way, it seems strange to me that the supermarket does not put holes for ventilation in the bag, to keep it from getting so wet.

What could be the history of this pan?,"I inherited this aluminum frying pan from my grandmother who passed away in 1998.

The handle has a wooden outer ""shroud"" painted black (well worn).


The exceptions to sitting in the cabinet, for this pan, for us, have been mostly to fry rueditas on the sideburner of the grill. This is due to the downward bulge in the center of the pan which makes it wobbly and a bit unsuitable for any sort of normal use.


Can anyone shed any light onto the age and history of this pan? Who made it? What year(s) was it in production? Etc.? Also owing to its center-bulge, most of the maker's markings are worn off. I'm not sure if I'm dealing with something from the $1 stores of the mid 90s or something from the late 40s shortly after my grandmother's marriage.

4. return shredded meat to braising liquid for another 30+ minutes
5. remove meat
6. broil meat for 5-7 minutes


In **between steps 2-3**, there was no mention of resting the meat. Perhaps that was implicit. Even if it was, it got me thinking. If you are returning the meat (post-shred) back to the braising liquid *without* ever having rested the meat, are you very likely compromising flavor and/or texture of the final product? If so, is that also a function of the animal and cut? Assume that any bled liquids from the shredding step are passed back to the braising mixture.

How can I make my baguette dough softer and more elastic?,"I've been practicing making french baguettes at home and am currently exploring the poolish method. I've collected numerous recipes and tried different variations.


My baguettes are OK but I'm looking for a way to improve all of my steps to make the end result as good looking and tasty as possible (still lots of room for improvement).


One thing I noticed is my dough doesn't look as soft and elastic as I would like after kneading it.  

Here's how I would love it to be:


![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rcd8O.png)
Source: <https://youtu.be/DkHsbchF2-g?t=228>.

What I end up with it this:


![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LdwaW.jpg)
It looks like an over-chewed bubble-gum and does not really stretch; but rather breaks apart.


I have a few ideas to improve that texture, but I'm afraid trying them all (and their combinations) would take me a long time, so I'm sharing them with you:


1. **Try another flour.** I bought mine at my baker's place asking the one they use for baguettes, but I'm afraid the shop assistant didn't hear this and gave me another one (or they add some other ingredients I'm not aware of).
2. **Knead less.** I'm currently relying on my home stand mixer and knead for about 5 minutes on low speed and 1 on medium.
3. **Knead by hand.** I haven't tried yet as it can become messy with kids running around :)
4. **Change recipe ratios.** I compiled my recipe research in [that tool (personal-use and French only for the moment)](https://bread-thing.netlify.app/) and am currently using the default (Baguette > Tradition) settings. See below for details.
5. **Adapt temperatures.** Same here, I'm using my tool's bottom calculator for the water temperature.

**The recipe**


* Prepare poolish with 2g fresh yeast, 196 g water and 196 g flour
* Let rest covered for 3 hours at room temperature
* Knead poolish with 196 g water, 6g fresh yeast, 12 g salt and 392 g flour, for 5 to 10 minutes on low speed and 1 to 2 minutes on medium speed
* Let rest covered for 1.5 hours

Yogurt from raw cow milk has a gelatinous consistency,"I've been making yogurt for a couple of years now, using commercial milk from the super market, with some very good success.


Recently decided to up my game by sourcing the milk directly at the farm, and I am now getting untreated raw cow milk.


However, the results are not satisfying, the yogurt has a gelatinous consistency, meaning that it does not break under the spoon. After cutting in the yogurt, the whey does not split neatly from the curd but they blend into a watery, soupy yogurt. The tastes is absolutely delicious however.


First I thought it had to do with fat contents. I then let the milk sit over night, skimmed the cream out of the milk and then used the skimmed milk as base for the yogurt. This improved the situation just a tad. Overall the yogurt remains gooey.


I am thinking of investing in a milk centrifuge to further extract fat from the milk, assuming the assumption about the fact is correct, but the process was not intensive enough to produce the expected results.


Or there is yet another factor I haven't thought about?


I am also doubting the theory, as I have had raw milk super fatty yogurt in rural India and it was definitely solid (perhaps more so than the yogurt made with skimmed milk).


Process:


* Bring milk to 100F

Using A Combination of Ghee and Unsalted Butter for Croissants,"Novice baker here. I live in South Africa, where it is difficult to find European style butter and the one we do have is exorbitantly expensive, around 50 euros for 500g.


The closest to European style that we've got is an 82.4% butter from [Lurpak](https://www.lurpak.com/en-za/our-products/lurpakr-unsalted-butter/)


I've already checked [here](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/35368/can-ghee-be-used-instead-of-butter-in-dessert-recipes) and [here](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/68602/substitutions-for-european-style-butter-in-croissants) for ideas on what to do and I'm of two minds.


I know that Ghee is basically the Indian version of clarified butter and that its taste is similar to that of oil but what would happen if I combined both the Lurpak butter and Ghee in order to create something that is of both worlds. It would both, have a higher fat content as well as not taste completely of oil. Am I hoping for too much? Would the croissants taste oily if I used this method?

Muffin casing anomaly: detachment,"**Preface**: This relate to cupcakes, too. Also, by ""casing,"" I'm referring to the paper wrapper that surrounds the base of the muffin and/or cupcake. For example, [this is the one](https://www.kroger.com/p/reynolds-pastels-paper-baking-cups/0001090063384?fulfillment=PICKUP&storecode=03400312&&cid=shp_adw_shopl_.kroger_g_lia_shop_acq_evgn_ship_pantry&gclid=CjwKCAjwrqqSBhBbEiwAlQeqGjuwnLFUY9ol0q738l1mwpo0qbXQayM6gqgWKF-slTKOJIAVmMg1GRoCxi4QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) I use. Lastly, there is plenty of info out there of *how to avoid* casing coupling to the baked product - this question is not about that.


Anytime I bake muffins with casings, they stick (and eventually rip of surficial parts of the base, which isn't grand). To mitigate this issue, I've noticed that the following (presumably *very* unconventional) workflow results in muffin casings cleanly detaching (or not sticking) to the baked product. Regardless of the fat or sugar concentration, this consistently works well. This workflow (to me) isn't really practical, but I'm curious to understand *how* it actually works.


After baking and letting the muffins sit on cooling racks (20-30 minutes), I then put them into (tied) bags and let them sit in relatively warm (80-90F), humid environment (RH, 60-80%) for 2-3 hours. Of course, residual heat from the muffins result in condensation within the bag, which slightly moistens the muffin crumb. For the muffins that I try to remove the casings right after or during cooling, sticking and ripping (some or a lot) occurs. However, for those that undergo this long, odd process, the wrappers cleanly, easily detach, and I'm profoundly confused by that.

How does no-knead bread not overproof?,"Most sourdough instructions warn not to overextend primary fermentation, as doing so will exhaust the yeast's food supply for proving after shaping. Standard sourdough recipes call for a 3-4 hour bulk fermentation stage.


*How, then, does no-knead bread not exhaust its food supply when such recipes call for more vigorous yeast variants than a sourdough starter (e.g. instant/active dry yeast) along with a 24 hour bulk fermentation?*


**Note:** Chad Robertson's *Tartine Bread* notes that glutens in the dough begin degrading after a certain point due to increasing acidity. Perhaps this is an additional factor that separates the two methods, as the no-knead bread doesn't have an acid-laden levain to contend with?

Automated stirring in a domestic kitchen,"I'm currently making 9 litres of quite thick lentil soup in a 10 litre stainless steel stockpot. It needs to simmer gently for an hour or two. Despite the sandwich base and my weakest gas ring on minimum\*, it needs stirring every few minutes or it will stick, and soon burn.


I've found this with other similar soups too (e.g. split pea and ginger) and dal. What they have in common is that they're too thick to convect properly. Today's is worse because I'm making it extra thick thicker for further dilution to serve about 40 people. Small batches can be done n my 3.5 litre slow cooker, though even in that it can stick.


Because this cooks for quite a long time, I need to be able to get on with other things, not all in the kitchen. So I wondered about solutions for automated stirring. In small vessels in the lab, for example, there are magnetic stirrers built in to hotplates. Is there something larger for use at home, whether a product (perhaps something that could be repurposed), a DIY design, or something I haven't considered.

I often want to do this at home, but often fail on the timings.


I'm assuming here that a lot of this will be compensated by ""Hot holding"", either in pans or by quickly blitzing food under a grill or boiler. There is also the number of staff involved, and as each chef will deal with a specialty dish, this will be a lot easier to coordinate than than with just one person in the kitchen.

How to retain the saltiness and spicy flavour of biryani rice?,"When preparing chicken dum biryani, the chicken and rice are first partially cooked separately. The steps for cooking the rice go like this:


1. Wash the rice.
2. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes.
3. For each cup of rice used, take two cups of water and boil it.
4. Add some whole spices to the water, and add some ghee or oil to the
water.
5. Add just enough salt to the water that it tastes like sea water (one
recipe actually mentioned this 'sea water' bit).
6. When the water starts boiling, take the rice and add it to the
boiling water. The water will take some time to get to a boil again.
Once it does, cook the rice for 8 minutes or until it is cooked 80%
(al-dente).
7. Switch off the flame.
8. **Immediately strain the rice in a colander or pour cold water to cool
the rice and stop it from getting cooked further. Drain the water from the rice**.


For step 8, one recipe was ok with washing the partially cooked rice further, to get rid of any extra starch floating around.


**My questions:**  

**Question 1.** When I cooled the rice by pouring cool water in step 8 and then drained the water, the rice lost the saltiness that's crucial to the biryani taste. The end result was a bland biryani. Even the spiciness of the whole spices added to the water was missing. What exactly is the point of adding salt, spices and ghee to the water, if the water is to be thrown off? How can the salty taste be retained?


**Question 2.** If I do not drain the water, the rice tastes good (because the salt and spices are retained), but it ends up getting cooked further and becomes mushy or sticky. Is there a way to cook the rice without it become mushy, but also not having to drain the water? The rice should get fully cooked eventually though.


None of the recipes I checked, mentioned the details of how to retain the taste and flavour while still ensuring that the rice does not get mushy or sticky. I primarily use jeera rice, but sometimes use basmati rice too.

Preparing To Teach Someone How to Bake a Whole Wheat Yeast Bread,"I'm going to be teaching a friend how to bake bread. She has never baked bread or had any experience with a bread-like dough.

hydration: 80-83%

* is 80% a good hydration level? (I want a dough that will be easy to work with)
* should I do an autolyse?
* how do I determine the percentage of dry active or instant yeast (I have both)?
* do I ferment and proof until double the size (I do much less for sourdough)?
* why do some recipes say to ""punch down"" the dough after the first rise? This is not typically done with sourdough.

I'd like to make it both shelf-stable and more portable. In particular it's a very component of the energy/electrolyte drinks I use when cycling long distances\* so a dry form would be lighter and more compact than a small bottle of liquid.


So I'd like to dry it to flavoured sugar. Considering my options:


* I have a dehydrator, but that's meant for solids, and would be very slow at shifting that much water.
* I'm sure I couldn't simmer off all the water, but a stovetop reduction might be a good first step.
* Can it be done in the oven? My instinct is that I'd end up with a solid layer stuck firmly to a baking sheet, but perhaps putting it in/on something flexible would allow me to crack it off the surface.

How do I make even layers of puree for dehydrator?,"""Fruit"" leathers are useful to store all the goodness of orchard - and garden! - produce.

Why do some egg products smell like spit and how can I prevent this from happening?,"There's a certain gross smell I notice with certain egg products that smells kinda like spit and kinda like a wet dog, very different from the smell of rotten or overcooked eggs.


People I've asked about this have no idea what I'm talking about, so it's possible that I'm sensitive to it but that most people aren't.


Foods with the smell:


* frozen custard from ice cream restaurants
* homemade fried rice that gets raw egg thrown in while it's cooking
* homemade spaetzle egg pasta


Foods without the smell as far as I can tell:


* scrambled eggs
* over-easy eggs
* poached eggs
* meringue
* raw eggs
* bread pudding


I've fixed fried rice by just cooking the eggs separately before adding them in and frozen custard by just eating ice cream instead, but I have no idea how to fix spaetzle, which is a shame, because I like the shape and texture.


My (not very confident) best guess is that undercooked egg yolks exposed to water cause some sort of microbe to grow and give off a smell, which is presumably also the process that causes wet dog and spit smell, but I don't know how or why it would happen so fast in water that's boiling or nearly boiling (frozen custard is pasteurized, right?), and I'm not sure how to prevent it. If that's the problem, maybe cooking longer or hotter or adding salt or something would discourage the bugs from growing?

How to mix chocolate into flourless ground almond cake?,"**TL;DR: When should I add melted chocolate to a ground almond cake recipe?**

**Ingredients:**


* 6 eggs
* 200g ground almonds
* 50g sugar


**Method:**


1. Whisk eggs and sugar on high speed until fluffy (~10 mins)
2. Fold in the ground almonds in 2 or 3 batches until combined
3. Bake in a greased, spring-form pan for 25 mins at 180c in a pre-heated oven, or until a skewer comes out clean

Can anyone suggest when the appropriate time in this recipe would be to add melted chocolate?

Example:


This is my (anti-stick) grill pan. At least in my country, **when we say 'grill cooking' it means with a small amount of oil, just spreading it over the surface with a silicone brush**. It's not 'dirty' or always like this. I was still cooking (chicken breast in this case, still a piece left that took longer). I took this picture on purpose for this question.


[![Grill pan after cooking](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bVmZBm.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bVmZBm.jpg)


What I like doing is, after the meat or whatever is done, I add and brush the surface with a little bit of oil and water (usually boiling hot from a kettle). With a silicone spatula I ""clean it"" to get all the remains and colors/flavours in the liquid, and then I add leftover rice (made in a rice cooker after rinsing it). I might add some soy sauce or oyster sauce as well.


More or less like a mix between Mediterranean and Asian methodologies. But I have been told a few times: ""**You will damage the grill by adding water**."". One of the main arguments is that the difference in temperature can ruin the iron/material. As I mentioned, the water is boiling hot (approx. 100°C).

"When stretching and folding dough and it gets tight, is that time to let it rest?","When I make my sourdough, a rested dough will stretch and fold 3-4 times before quite suddenly going tight. At this point it's likely to tear if I stretch much more. Should I put it down and rest it again, keeping stretching with some tearing, keep stretching but more gently, or what?


My typical loaf is a 50% wholemeal seeded\* sourdough. I'm not going for the very open crumb found in many white sourdoughs, but more of a tasty sandwich loaf - I also bake it in a tin. But it's perhaps a little dense. It's initially kneaded in my stand mixer at 59% hydration, then after 30-60 minutes I add the seeds, salt and more water bringing it up to 65-70% (hard to judge exactly because I soak the seeds and they bring some water with them). Once the dough comes together again in the mixer, which normally involves some resting, I stop it and let it rest. Then I stretch and folding every half hour or so until bedtime (a variable number of times depending on when I started). After the last stretch I roughly shape it and put it in a loaf tin, pressing it into the corners. The tearing happens preferentially at the seeds but can occur anywhere. This routine works with my evenings, and is adapted from the recipe I got with the starter.

```

I make risotto as follows;


1. Sauté carrots,and celeries and then garlic, shallots and leeks.
2. Add 1 cup of rice, sautéed a bit and add white wine.
3. When wine is almost gone, start adding a scoop of hot(almost boiling) stock.
4. Stir occasionally and add additional stock when the precious stock is almost gone.
5. Add butter and seasoning.


The whole thing takes about 30-40min. At the end, I check and make sure risotto is nicely done. It gets creamy but when I taste it, arborio rice is still grainy; it is almost like a grain of rice breaks down in small pieces.


I followed some of the suggestion in the previous post; [How can I make my risotto less firm?](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/6391/how-can-i-make-my-risotto-less-firm)


but I am still getting the same result. I'd really appreciate any pointers to this.

"Conflicting advice on which knife to use when cutting up a chicken, which should I use?","I recently took part in a knife skills workshop and during part of that workshop we were taught how to cut up a whole chicken into different sections.


I was expecting to use a boning knife for this task, but in fact our instructor had said that the best knife to use was in fact a paring knife as it is easier to use and handle when getting around the chicken. As a group, we typically worked around the joints, rather than trying to cut through them, to keep the cuts as neat as possible.


From looking online, almost all advice seems to advocate using a boning knife. I would like to go through the exercise of cutting up a chicken a few times at home, but I am now unsure which knife I need to be using for this task?

When should I use a rounded balloon whisk attachment vs a bulb-shaped balloon whisk attachment,"Many electric whisks come with two balloon whisk attachments: A bulb-shaped whisk and a rounded whisk. Is there a specific reason I should prefer one or the other? Both seem to yield similar results.

Cloudy sediment in home canned pickles,"I've home-canned some pickled vegetables recently and there is a cloudy sediment in the brine. I'd like to know what causes it and how to prevent it.


It is not spoilage. It only seems to affect the visual aesthetic of the pickles.


Here is an image that shows the sediment near the bottom of the jar [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JfZrH.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JfZrH.jpg)


The recipe I'm using is ""End of Garden Pickles"" on page 323 of Ball's Complete Book of Home Preserving. The ingredients are zucchini, green beans, carrots, pearl onions, bell pepper, vinegar, sugar, dry mustard, mustard seeds, pickling salt, ground cinnamon, ground ginger. I've seen it with other recipes too though.


It seems like the cause is probably hard water or starch in the vegetables from this [document's](https://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://extension.oregonstate.edu/sites/default/files/documents/8836/sp50742problemsandsolutionsvegetables.pdf) mention of ""white sediment"". Also, this [document](https://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://nchfp.uga.edu/publications/nchfp/tech_bull/0Judging_Preserved_full.pdf) on judging pickles acknowledges the occurrence of sediment and suggests it's preventable. Unfortunately, neither document shows a picture to compare against and neither gives a tip to prevent it if the problem is starch.


Does anyone recognize this sediment and know how to prevent or reduce it?

What is this elongated plastic and metal utensil?,"I inherited this utensil as part of a larger cutlery case containing lots of other stuff, all related to the kitchen somehow.
I do not know what this is supposed to be for, it might even be part of something else.
There is what seems to be a hole for a screw, and a long elongated plastic thing squishes between the metal frame.

"How much salt in ""only salt"" beef jerky","I'm getting ready to smoke a batch of beef jerky, but am setting some aside so that the only seasoning will be the salt and the smoke. 1) I normally put so much seasoning that it hides most of the smoke nuances, and 2) I have a friend who needs to taste them side by side so I plan on doing this with one batch mesquite smoked and one batch hickory smoked.


My normal recipe calls for 1/2cup soy sauce per 2lb beef. My soy sauce bottle says 15ml=.960g sodium Assuming nearly water density of 1ml = 1g, that's 6.4% sodium. Online shows salt is 40% sodium, so my math gives 2.4g salt in 15ml of soy sauce. 236.5ml per cup would be 18.92g per half/cup water.


So 1) is that right. and 2) Is that actually ""the whole story"". Is that enough salt without all of the other seasonings (worcestershire, which I'm sure adds more salt, plus spices and such) to aid the preservation? Or is it going to be too much salt without all of the other flavors to offset it?


Or would I be better off just enthusiastically salting the individual slices for a ""dry brine"" like I do a brisket or something?

Can one prepare yogurt in sealed glass jars?,"I prepare yogurt, which I place in 200 ml jars with lug/twist off caps.


When I prepare the yogurt, the milk is first heated at 145F and cooled to about 108F before adding yogurt inoculant. The content is placed in jars for incubation, but they do not seal in the process (for obvious reasons).


To seal jars properly, they are normally submerged in boiling water with their content. In the case of yogurt though, this would probably cook the yogurt and kill off all the nice bacteria.


Is there any way to achieve sealing yogurt-filled jars without damaging the yogurt content?

"Is it advisable to cook cilantro or mint leaves and store them, instead of blanching them?","**The problem:**  

The grocer only agrees to give a large bunch of cilantro (coriander) or mint leaves, and I need it to last a month or more, because I don't use the herbs as frequently.


**What I've tried earlier:**


* I've poured some water into the plastic bags containing the cilantro
or mint, so that their roots (and leaves) were wet, and this was
stored in the fridge. (turns out, wet leaves [tend to rot faster](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/19470/why-does-fresh-coriander-deteriorate-so-quickly/19473#19473))
* I've blanched cilantro leaves, placed it in a plastic zip-lock bag
and kept it in the freezer. When I took it out and let it thaw, it
looked like greenish yellow seaweed, and a good amount of water had
collected in the plastic bag. The cilantro didn't smell too good
either.


**What I'm asking about:**  

I want to know if it's advisable to chop up fresh cilantro or mint leaves, boil some water or oil in a thick-bottomed container, and simmer the chopped cilantro or mint in it until it gets fully cooked. Then I could store it in the fridge or chill-tray (or if it's cooked in oil, I guess I could store it in the freezer). I'm hoping this would make it last longer and preserve the flavors too. One thing I'm worried about is, whether cooking it in this manner will make the cilantro taste bitter. When making mixed vegetables curry or chicken curry, whenever I've added cilantro before adding the chicken or vegetables, the curry ended up having a slightly bitter taste.


*ps: From [this answer](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/3176/7812), I see I can store them in the freezer without blanching (but it needs to be [kept within a paper towel](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/473/7812)). It is [said to](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/7607/7812) mess with the texture though.*
